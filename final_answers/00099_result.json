  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - The ego appears to be traveling in the left lane of a multi\u2010lane road.  \n   - A large left\u2010turn arrow is painted on the pavement in the ego\u2019s lane.  \n   - There is a physical median to the left.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - A sign ahead clearly states **\u201cLEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT.\u201d**  \n   - The same strong pavement marking (left arrow) is visible, confirming that this lane is designated for left turns only.  \n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - Traffic is visible ahead, queuing at a signalized intersection.  \n   - The ego remains in the same left\u2010most lane, which continues to show markings for a left turn.  \n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - Another prominent left\u2010arrow is painted on the road in the ego\u2019s lane.  \n   - The intersection up ahead has a traffic signal with multiple lanes: the right lanes appear to go straight, while the left lane is for turning left.  \n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - The dashed lines and the arrow on the roadway confirm that the ego\u2019s current lane continues to feed into a left\u2010turn movement at the intersection.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nAcross all frames, the repeated markings and signage (\u201cLEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\u201d) show that the ego is in a mandatory left\u2010turn lane. Standard traffic rules require the ego driver to follow the lane\u2019s designated direction.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices:**\n\n- **A. Turn left**: Matches the signage and pavement markings for the lane the ego is occupying.  \n- **B. Turn right**: Inconsistent with both the lane markings and signage.  \n- **C. Go straight**: Again, the chosen lane is restricted to turning left.  \n- **D. Park**: There is no indication or reason to stop/park here.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
