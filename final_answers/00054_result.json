  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 We see a green traffic light at an intersection with multiple lanes ahead. The overhead sign reads \u201cFM 969,\u201d and to the right in the far distance are a pair of diamond\u2010shaped signs but not yet clearly readable.  \n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 The view is still of the same wide intersection under a green light. The two diamond\u2010shaped signs on the far right\u2010hand side become a bit clearer, though not fully legible yet.  \n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 As the ego\u2010vehicle proceeds through the light, it becomes more evident that at least one of the diamond\u2010shaped signs indicates a \u201cMerge Left.\u201d  \n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 The \u201cMerge Left\u201d sign on the right is now quite visible; this typically warns that the right lane will end, forcing traffic to merge left. The roadway remains otherwise clear, with no obvious large obstructions in the center lanes.  \n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 Now fully past the intersection, the camera view shows the \u201cMERGE LEFT\u201d signage on the right, confirming the lane layout ahead. There is a small dark object on the road surface, but it appears minor and is aligned centrally\u2014likely not the primary reason for a significant swerve or lane change.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 The main traffic control device is a green light; there is no need to stop or accelerate unusually.  \n\u2022 Multiple frames show a \u201cMerge Left\u201d warning, suggesting that the right lane tapers.  \n\u2022 While there appears to be some dark object on the road in Frame 5, the posted signage indicates the primary required maneuver is to merge left because of lane transition rather than veer left to avoid debris.  \n\u2022 There is no signage or obvious roadway indication that the driver must speed up for a highway entrance.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) Continue straight in a nominal scenario: This ignores the \u201cMerge Left\u201d signs.  \n\u2022 (B) Veer left for a merge: Matches the indication in multiple frames that the right lane merges left.  \n\u2022 (C) Veer left for debris: Although a small object is visible, the posted signage\u2014and the typical roadway marking\u2014makes the lane merge the key reason for moving left.  \n\u2022 (D) Speed up for the upcoming highway: There is no sign indicating a direct highway on\u2010ramp or a required speed\u2010up.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \nThe correct behavior is to **merge (veer) left** because the posted \u201cMerge Left\u201d signs warn that the right lane is ending.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
