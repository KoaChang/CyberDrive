  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1** \u2013 The fire truck is in the leftmost through\u2010traffic lane (the far\u2010left signal head is showing a red left\u2010turn arrow, while the circular green to the right is lit). The truck is oriented straight, without a turn signal on or wheels angled.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2** \u2013 The fire truck remains in the same lane, continuing forward. No sign of merging right, and there is no additional left lane into which it might move.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3** \u2013 Still no movement toward any lane boundary. The truck stays lined up to go straight; the left\u2010turn arrow remains red.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4** \u2013 The light remains green for through traffic. The fire truck is not slowing, signaling, or drifting.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5** \u2013 The truck is progressing straight with no lateral movement or brake\u2010light indication, and the left\u2010turn arrow is still red.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAlthough it occupies the leftmost lane, that lane is for going straight or turning left. The dedicated left\u2010turn arrow is red, so left\u2010turn traffic is stopped. The fire truck shows no sign of turning or merging right; it is simply proceeding through the intersection under the green light.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Stay in lane** \u2013 Matches the consistent path of the fire truck (no lane changes, no turn).  \n\u2022 **B. Lane change to the left** \u2013 Impossible here, as the truck is already against the left edge of through traffic.  \n\u2022 **C. Lane change to the right** \u2013 No movement or signal to that effect.  \n\u2022 **D. Stop** \u2013 The truck is clearly moving forward on a green light, so no stop is expected.  \n\n<answer>A</answer>",
