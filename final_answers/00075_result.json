  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The ego vehicle is behind a blue SUV in the center lane. Concrete barriers appear ahead on the left side, and road signs indicate routes for \u201cWest 290 / 71 Texas.\u201d Road markings show \u201cONLY\u201d for the lane on the left, but nothing unusual occupies the lane directly ahead yet.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: A worker in an orange vest is visible near the median, and one can see barricades placed to block access to the ramp on the left. The lane directly in front of the ego car is still open at this moment.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: Traffic cones come into view on the right side of the center lane, near the side of a large trailer. One orange cone is placed in front of the blue SUV\u2019s path.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: More traffic cones are set down in front of the ego vehicle, beginning to occupy or block part of the center lane.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: Multiple cones clearly occupy the lane in front of the ego vehicle, with a few cones stretching diagonally across its path.\n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:  \nFrom Frame 3 onward, cones are being placed across the lane where the ego vehicle is traveling. By Frame 5, several cones have fully appeared in front, indicating that the lane is obstructed by these cones rather than being clear to proceed or having a parked or hazard\u2010lit vehicle.\n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:  \n\u2022 (A) It is clear to proceed \u2013 Contradicted by the appearance of multiple cones in the lane.  \n\u2022 (B) There is a parked car in front \u2013 No parked car is seen; instead, cones block the lane.  \n\u2022 (C) There is a car with hazard lights on \u2013 No such vehicle is observed.  \n\u2022 (D) There are traffic cones \u2013 Frames 3 through 5 confirm cones placed directly ahead.\n\n4.
