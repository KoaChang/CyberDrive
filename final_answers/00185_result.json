  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 We see an orange \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d sign on the right shoulder. There are also traffic cones further down the street, though the entire lane is not yet clearly shown to be blocked.  \n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 The \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d sign is still prominent; additional cones appear in the distance. A \u201cDetour\u201d sign is now faintly visible behind the parked red vehicle on the right.  \n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 The cones extend across the center of the roadway, and the \u201cDetour\u201d sign behind them is clearer. It appears to direct traffic away from continuing straight.  \n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 The \u201cDetour\u201d sign and the line of cones indicate a likely closure or partial blockage straight ahead. The cones occupy much of the lane we would use if going straight.  \n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 We see a continued setup of cones and the \u201cDetour\u201d sign, suggesting that through\u2010traffic straight ahead is being diverted. It does not look like there is a fully open path to continue straight beyond the intersection.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAlthough the ego vehicle\u2019s navigation calls for going straight, the \u201cDetour\u201d sign and the placement of cones across the forward lane strongly imply that continuing straight is not permitted (or at least not advisable) due to roadwork. Standard traffic practice is to heed a \u201cDetour\u201d sign, which typically indicates that one must turn off the intended path to avoid a closure.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A. Turn left.** Nothing in the signs or lane markings suggests a left turn is the designated detour.  \n- **B. Go straight.** The road cones and \u201cDetour\u201d sign point to a closure or partial blockage, so continuing straight is likely improper.  \n- **C. Turn right.** This is the usual detour direction when signage is placed on the right with cones partially blocking the straight path.  \n- **D. Reverse.** There is no need to reverse unless there is absolutely no other way, and the detour plainly offers an alternate path.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
