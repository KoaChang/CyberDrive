  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The camera is centered in a single through\u2010lane in each direction with a solid double\u2010yellow centerline. A traffic signal ahead is green; there is no sign or marking indicating \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d or \u201cLeft Turn Only on Arrow.\u201d  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** An oncoming car is visible in the opposite lane but there is still no indication of any left\u2010turn\u2010only arrow or prohibition. No \u201cOne Way\u201d signage is apparent at the cross street.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The oncoming car passes by. Still no posted sign that would forbid a left turn or require waiting for a dedicated green arrow.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** Approaching the intersection, you can see the crosswalk and standard overhead signals; there is no \u201cLeft Turn Signal Only\u201d sign or additional left\u2010turn arrow.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The intersection is fully visible. The signals remain the standard circular green lights, with no restriction signage on the mast arms.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nSince there is no signage stipulating \u201cNo Left Turn,\u201d no indication the cross street is one\u2010way in the wrong direction, and no separate left\u2010turn signal that must be awaited, a conventional unprotected left turn (i.e., yield to oncoming traffic) appears both legal and (provided you yield appropriately) safe.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. No it\u2019s a one way going right.** \u2013 There is no indication the cross street is a one\u2010way.  \n\u2022 **B. No we have to wait for left turn signal.** \u2013 The overhead lights are standard greens, and there is no posted requirement that left turns must have a protected arrow.  \n\u2022 **C. No there is oncoming traffic.** \u2013 While there was an oncoming vehicle earlier, one can legally wait for traffic to clear and then turn. That does not make the left turn itself illegal.  \n\u2022 **D. Yes it is legal and safe.** \u2013 Absent prohibitive signs or special signals, and once oncoming traffic is clear, the turn is legally and safely permitted.  \n\n<answer>D</answer>",
