  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1 & 2:**  The oncoming headlights are still some distance away.  Road signs on the right (from our dashcam\u2019s viewpoint) indicate a cross\u2010intersection ahead and show that our right lane becomes a dedicated right\u2010turn lane (\u201cONLY\u201d).  The opposing (oncoming) side of the roadway does not yet reveal the pickup\u2019s maneuver.\n\n2. **Frame 3:**  The large \u201cONLY\u201d marking in our right lane is fully visible, reinforcing that _our_ right lane is for turning right at the upcoming intersection.  Across the double yellow lines, the oncoming vehicle is closer, but it is still not clear which way it will turn.\n\n3. **Frame 4:**  The oncoming pickup (now clearly visible to the right side of the video) is slowing or stopped near a side road.  It is angled in such a way that it is not continuing straight.  Notably, there is a stop sign facing _its_ direction\u2014likely the pickup is on the main road with an option to turn onto that side road.\n\n4. **Frame 5:**  The pickup\u2019s position and angle make it clear it is initiating a turn rather than parking or driving straight.  Because the side street is to _our_ right, it is to the pickup\u2019s **left** (since it is oncoming traffic).  The truck appears poised to cross in front of our path onto the side street.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\n\u2022\u202fSince our lane markings and signage show a right\u2010turn\u2010only lane for _our_ direction, that same side road lies on the _left_ side for vehicles coming the opposite way.  \n\u2022\u202fThe pickup\u2019s slowing/stopped position with a clear angle toward that side road indicates it will cross opposing traffic to enter that road.  \n\u2022\u202fHence, from the pickup driver\u2019s perspective, this is a **left turn** at the intersection.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A. Continue straight?**  The pickup is clearly angled off the main travel lane and is not carrying on straight down the road.  \n- **B. Right turn?**  From the pickup driver\u2019s own viewpoint, the turn to that side road would be to their left, not right.  \n- **C. Left turn?**  All evidence (signage, pickup\u2019s positioning, and the geometry of the intersection) points to a left turn from the oncoming driver\u2019s perspective.  \n- **D. Park?**  The pickup is not simply pulling over or parking; its positioning at the intersection indicates an imminent turn.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C. Left turn</answer>",
