  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:  \n   \u2022 Frame 1: The Fit\u2019s left and right taillights appear identically lit (likely brake lights). No separate turn\u2010signal section is visibly flashing or illuminated on one side more than the other.  \n   \u2022 Frame 2: The lighting remains the same: both taillights are still illuminated, with no sign of a blinking turn signal.  \n   \u2022 Frame 3: Same lighting pattern\u2014no change in the left or right clusters that would indicate an activated blinker.  \n   \u2022 Frame 4: A black pickup passes on the right but the Fit\u2019s rear lights remain unchanged and symmetrical.  \n   \u2022 Frame 5: A red sports car passes on the right; again, there is no flicker or difference in the Fit\u2019s lights from either side that would denote turn\u2010signal activity.  \n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:  \n   Since the car is stopped at a light, the brake lights are on steadily in all frames. If a blinker (left, right, or hazards) were active, one or both sides would flash or show a visibly brighter/different pattern across frames. No such difference is apparent.  \n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:  \n   A. \u201cNo blinker is on\u201d fits the observation that neither side shows a blinking or otherwise distinct turn\u2010signal glow.  \n   B. \u201cLeft blinker is on\u201d is inconsistent with the identical left/right lighting.  \n   C. \u201cRight blinker is on\u201d is also inconsistent for the same reason.  \n   D. \u201cHazard lights are on\u201d would show flashing on both sides, which is not visible.  \n\n4.
