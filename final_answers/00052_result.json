  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - Three lanes are visible. A large truck is over on the right lane, a black sedan (the dashcam car is behind it) is in the middle lane, and a silver sedan is in the left lane.  \n   - Overhead sign on the far right shows a right\u2010turn arrow labeled \u201cSamuell Blvd,\u201d which strongly suggests that the rightmost lane is for right turns only.\n\n2. **Frame 2 and Frame 3:**  \n   - The lines on the pavement do not show any left\u2010turn\u2010only markings in the left lane. No signage or overhead arrows indicate \u201cleft only\u201d for that lane.  \n   - The black sedan in the middle lane sits behind a \u2018full\u2019 traffic light (rather than a dedicated turn arrow sign). This is typically a through\u2010movement signal.\n\n3. **Frame 4 and Frame 5:**  \n   - The silver sedan remains in the left lane, but still no markings or traffic\u2010control signals indicate that lane is only for left turns.  \n   - The overhead right\u2010arrow sign remains clearly posted for the far\u2010right lane.\n\nFrom all five frames, it appears that only the far\u2010right lane is signed or signaled to turn right. The left and middle lanes are free to continue straight; no evidence suggests that the left lane is forced to turn left. Hence:\n\n**Conclusion / Matching to Options**\n\n\u2022 The left lane goes straight (and possibly also allows left turns, but is not left\u2010only).  \n\u2022 The middle lane clearly goes straight.  \n\u2022 The right lane is dedicated to turning right.  \n\nTherefore, there are **two** lanes that go straight through the intersection.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
