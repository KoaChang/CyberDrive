  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - Far in the distance, the signals for the through\u2010lanes appear green. The left\u2010turn signal head is too small to distinguish its exact color, but it appears active (likely green at this moment).\n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - As we get closer, the left\u2010turn signal to the far left still looks illuminated. Again, it suggests a protected arrow is currently on (green), though still not definitive from this distance.\n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - We see the through\u2010lanes are green. The separate left\u2010turn signal on the overhead mast appears to be lit but not clearly red or yellow\u2014it is likely still green (protected left phase).\n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The vertical signal on the far left pole has its lower arrow lamp glowing green. Meanwhile, the overhead left\u2010turn signal lens is harder to distinguish, but it appears it may be transitioning soon.\n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - Now, the left\u2010turn arrow on the overhead signal clearly shows an amber (yellowish) color. It is not red (which would be bright red), nor does it show any sign of flashing. The arrow is simply illuminated solid yellow.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross frames 1\u20133, the arrow is likely green (protected left turn). By frames 4\u20135, this changes to an amber color. Because the question specifically asks between \u201csolid yellow,\u201d \u201cflashing yellow,\u201d \u201csolid red,\u201d or \u201cflashing red,\u201d and the final frame shows a steady amber color (not blinking and not red), the correct match is a **solid yellow** left\u2010turn arrow.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 It is not red in Frame 5, ruling out (C) and (D).  \n\u2022 It does not exhibit an on\u2010off pattern, ruling out (B) \u201cFlashing yellow.\u201d  \n\u2022 The remaining choice that fits a steady amber appearance is (A) **Solid yellow**.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
