  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. In the first frame, the lane marking directly ahead of the ego vehicle is a large curved arrow pointing left, with \u201cONLY\u201d stenciled on the pavement. No combination arrows (e.g., left+through) appear.  \n2. The second and third frames confirm the same marking: a single left arrow, reinforced by the word \u201cONLY.\u201d  \n3. Frames four and five do not show any additional arrow or shared\u2010movement markings\u2014again just the same left\u2010turn\u2010only arrow and text.  \n4. No signage overhead or on the mast arms indicates that this lane also permits traveling straight; the adjacent lanes to the right appear to be either through lanes or right\u2010turn lanes.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 A lane painted with a single arrow and \u201cONLY,\u201d pointing left, is generally reserved by traffic law for left turns exclusively.  \n\u2022 If the lane allowed both straight and left, the marking typically would display two arrows (one straight, one left).  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) Turn left only. This matches exactly with a left\u2010arrow\u2010only lane.  \n\u2022 (B) Turn right only. Not supported by the lane markings.  \n\u2022 (C) Turn left and go straight. Would require a combination arrow (left + straight). Not present here.  \n\u2022 (D) Turn right and go straight. Not supported given the clear left\u2010turn arrow and \u201cONLY.\u201d  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A. Turn left only.</answer>",
