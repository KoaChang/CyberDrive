  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n\u2022 **Frame 1**  \n  \u2013 Sign cluster on the median indicates two left\u2010turn lanes (one strictly left, one left\u2010or\u2010through).  \n  \u2013 To the right of those, multiple lane dividers are visible, suggesting at least three lanes continue forward.  \n\n\u2022 **Frame 2**  \n  \u2013 Slightly closer look confirms a split median and bollards that begin separating the two left\u2010turn lanes from the remaining lanes to the right.  \n  \u2013 Lane markings to the right show distinct dashed lines, hinting at three separate lanes continuing forward.  \n\n\u2022 **Frame 3**  \n  \u2013 Clearly shows two large left\u2010turn arrows (far left lane plus the lane immediately to its right).  \n  \u2013 To the right of the bollards, three lanes extend ahead.  \n\n\u2022 **Frame 4**  \n  \u2013 The yellow posts on the median further isolate the dual left\u2010turn pocket from the three lanes on the right.  \n  \u2013 Pavement markings (\u201cCLEAR,\u201d \u201cKEEP\u201d) are spread across those three right lanes, confirming there are indeed three lanes in that segment.  \n\n\u2022 **Frame 5**  \n  \u2013 Best overall view. Two left\u2010turn lanes (separated by the posts) plus three lanes continuing straight or possibly turning right.  \n  \u2013 No evidence of a sixth lane for the ego direction beyond those five.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the frames, we consistently see two lanes allocated for left turns, physically separated by an island or bollards from three other lanes. No additional lane markings appear for a sixth lane.  \n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **3 lanes (A)** too few, because we see two left\u2010turn lanes plus at least three going straight.  \n\u2022 **4 lanes (B)** still too few, given the two clearly marked left\u2010turn lanes plus three to the right.  \n\u2022 **5 lanes (C)** matches what is visible: two left\u2010turn lanes and three lanes to the right.  \n\u2022 **6 lanes (D)** no markings indicate a sixth lane.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
