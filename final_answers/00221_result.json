  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** In the distance, overhead signs are visible but somewhat small. The left sign appears to reference \u201cLockhart\u201d and the right sign \u201cLampasas,\u201d though the distances are not fully legible at this point.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The overhead signs remain the same, stating directions to US 183 South (Lockhart) and US 183 North (Lampasas). The mileages are more discernible\u2014both appear to mention fractional mile indications, but the numerals are still not crystal-clear from this frame alone.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The overhead sign for 183 South (Lockhart) clearly shows \u201cExit \u00be Mile,\u201d and for 183 North (Lampasas) it shows \u201cExit \u00bd Mile.\u201d This is where the distance to the Lockhart exit is easiest to read.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The Lockhart exit sign again confirms \u201cExit \u00be Mile,\u201d and the Lampasas exit sign states \u201cExit \u00bd Mile.\u201d  \n5. **Frame 5:** The overhead signs are farther in the distance and less readable, but frames 3\u20134 have already given a definitive view.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the frames, the signage consistently indicates that US 183 South to Lockhart is in \u00be mile. The closer (and presumably sooner) exit is for US 183 North (Lampasas), which is at \u00bd mile. Therefore, for \u201cSouth Lockhart,\u201d the exit distance given by the signs is \u00be mile.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (\u00bc mile) \u2013 Not supported by any signage.  \n\u2022 B (\u00bd mile) \u2013 This applies to the North/Lampasas exit, not the one to Lockhart.  \n\u2022 C (\u00be mile) \u2013 Matches the overhead sign for Lockhart in Frames 3 and 4.  \n\u2022 D (1 mile) \u2013 Not indicated on any sign.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
