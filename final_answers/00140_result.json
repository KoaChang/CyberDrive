  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: Near the right edge of the frame ahead, there is a rectangular white speed sign that reads \u201cSPEED LIMIT 25.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The same sign is more clearly visible to the right, again indicating \u201cSPEED LIMIT 25.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The sign remains visible, and it is unmistakably marked \u201c25.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The \u201cSPEED LIMIT 25\u201d sign is still in clear view on the right side of the roadway.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: Although the sign is now behind the ego vehicle\u2019s position, the previous frames have already made the limit apparent.\n\nContextual Reasoning:  \nAll frames show a residential neighborhood with a posted \u201cSPEED LIMIT 25\u201d sign. No other speed limit signs are visible that might suggest a higher or lower limit. Residential roads commonly have speed limits of 25 mph, which aligns with the sign in these frames.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:  \nA (15 mph) \u2192 Too low; contradicted by the large \u201c25\u201d sign.  \nB (25 mph) \u2192 Matches the posted sign in multiple frames.  \nC (35 mph) or D (55 mph) \u2192 Both are contradicted by the clearly visible \u201c25\u201d sign.\n\nProvide the Best Answer:\n<answer>B</answer>",
