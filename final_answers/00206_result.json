  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** From a distance, one can see at least one stop sign on the far right, but the view is oblique, so it is not yet clear how many total signs face the driver\u2019s approach.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** Now looking more centrally down the road, two STOP signs become visible: one on the left side near a tree, and one on the right side near the curb. Both are oriented toward the camera, indicating they would pertain to the driver. Additional stop signs are visible in the background for intersecting roads, but these appear angled away from the driver.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3 & 4:** As the vehicle continues forward, the same two STOP signs\u2014left and right\u2014remain in clear view, both still angled toward the driver. The other stop signs (further back and turned differently) govern cross or opposing traffic.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The camera has closed in on the intersection, and the near\u2010side pair of STOP signs (left and right) is obviously intended for the approaching vehicle\u2014there is no additional stop sign in the center or elsewhere that faces this lane.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nOnly the signs oriented toward the oncoming driver are \u201crelevant to ego.\u201d Although multiple signs appear around the intersection, the two that face the forward\u2010moving lane (one on the left shoulder/median, one on the right shoulder) are the ones the driver must observe and obey.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A (1 Stop Sign)** \u2013 Not correct, as there is clearly more than one sign facing the driver.  \n\u2022 **B (2 Stop Signs)** \u2013 Matches the view: a left\u2010side and a right\u2010side STOP, both facing the approaching lane.  \n\u2022 **C (3 Stop Signs) or D (4 Stop Signs)** \u2013 The extra signs seen do not face the driver\u2019s lane but rather cross traffic.  \n\n**Best Answer**  \n<answer>2</answer>",
