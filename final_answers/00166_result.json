  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** We see parked cars to the right and oncoming cars on the left, but no sign of any jogger or pedestrian crossing.  \n2. **Frame 2:** Similar overall scene; still no pedestrian\u2010related markings or individuals visible.  \n3. **Frame 3:** We begin to see a painted crosswalk area in the distance (the striped marking across the road is coming into view), though no pedestrian is clearly in sight.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The crosswalk stripes are more apparent, and a yield sign for pedestrians is visible on the right\u2010hand side near the roadway. We still do not clearly see the jogger yet.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The crosswalk is fully visible, along with a \u201cYield\u201d sign pointing to a pedestrian crossing. A jogger/runner in dark clothing stands on the right side, next to that pedestrian sign. They appear poised to cross at the marked crosswalk.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBy the last frame, we have:  \n\u2022 A clearly marked crosswalk across the travel lane.  \n\u2022 A yield sign indicating that drivers must cede the right\u2010of\u2010way to pedestrians.  \n\u2022 A jogger who is right at the edge of the crosswalk area.  \n\nStandard traffic rules require yielding to pedestrians who are in\u2014or about to enter\u2014a marked crosswalk. The jogger in Frame 5 is immediately adjacent to the crosswalk and appears to be waiting (or prepared) to cross.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A. Yes** \u2013 Given the law and the position of the jogger at a clearly marked crossing with a posted yield sign, the driver does indeed need to yield.  \n- **B. No** \u2013 This would contradict basic right\u2010of\u2010way rules, since the pedestrian is obviously intending to cross.  \n- **C. Unsure** \u2013 Although nighttime visibility is limited, the presence of the jogger at the crosswalk (and yield signage) is quite clear.  \n- **D. Insufficient information** \u2013 We do have enough detail (a visible jogger by the crosswalk with a yield sign).\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
