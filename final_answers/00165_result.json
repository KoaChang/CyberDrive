  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: The camera shows a multilane road at night with a clearly marked pedestrian\u2010crossing sign on the right. The signal ahead appears green. The crosswalk itself is still farther up the road, and there are no visible pedestrians in or near it.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: Approaching the same crosswalk signs. The roadway remains clear of pedestrians. The overhead traffic lights remain green.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Now closer to the painted crosswalk lines. Signs indicating \u201cStop for Red\u201d are visible, but the traffic signal is still green. No pedestrians visible at the crossing.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The large, striped pedestrian crosswalk is now clearly in view. Though the area is well\u2010lit, there is no one in or entering the crosswalk. The overhead signal continues to show green.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: Right before the crosswalk, with its stripes plainly on screen. Again, no pedestrians are in or near the crosswalk, and the traffic light is not red.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the traffic signal is green and there are no pedestrians waiting or stepping into the crosswalk, there is no legal or safety requirement to stop. The \u201cStop for Red\u201d sign applies if the signal were red, or if pedestrians were present requiring a stop/yield.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Come to a stop** \u2013 Not necessary here since the light is green and no pedestrians are present.  \n\u2022 **B. Wait for pedestrians to arrive** \u2013 Not applicable; no one is approaching the crosswalk.  \n\u2022 **C. Pullover** \u2013 There is no indication that the vehicle must pull over.  \n\u2022 **D. Proceed without stopping** \u2013 Matches standard practice: with no pedestrian conflict or red light, the driver should continue through the crosswalk.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>D</answer>",
