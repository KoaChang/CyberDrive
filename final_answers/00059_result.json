  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** We see a multilane downtown street at night. The black vehicle in question is ahead, roughly in the left or center\u2010left portion of the roadway. There is a traffic signal up ahead, but no clear indication (e.g., arrow) that it is providing a protected left turn.  \n2. **Frame 2:** As we get closer, the traffic light is still green (solid green circle), and the black vehicle is edging toward the intersection, still positioned in a way that suggests a possible left turn. No dedicated left arrow is visible.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The black vehicle\u2019s orientation is more clearly angled left; it is no longer centered in a lane going straight, and there do not appear to be any lane markings or lights indicating a protected left turn.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The vehicle appears to be passing the center line to turn left across opposing lanes. We do not see a left\u2010turn arrow illuminated on the signal overhead\u2014just the standard green traffic light.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The black vehicle is now committing to crossing the intersection on its left turn path, with no special turn arrow visible. This indicates the turn is made against oncoming traffic on a solid green (i.e. no dedicated/protected left).  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the frames, the black car is moving from a shared or through lane, angling left through the intersection. There is no sign of a green turn arrow or designated turn signal that would make it \u201cprotected.\u201d The car is clearly not proceeding straight or turning right.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n- A. **Unprotected left turn** \u2013 Matches what we see: a left turn without a special arrow or dedicated signal phase.  \n- B. **Protected left turn** \u2013 Would require a left\u2010turn arrow; not in evidence.  \n- C. **Driving straight** \u2013 Contradicted by the black vehicle\u2019s clear leftward maneuver.  \n- D. **A right turn** \u2013 Contradicted by the black vehicle\u2019s position and direction.  \n\n<answer>A. An unprotected left turn.</answer>",
