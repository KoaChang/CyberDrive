  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - The pavement markings in the left two lanes appear to say \u201cONLY,\u201d accompanied by overhead signs showing curved left arrows.  \n   - In the lane nearest the camera (the rightmost lane), a roadside sign shows a single curved arrow pointing right with \u201cONLY\u201d beneath it.  \n   - Although full lane markings are not entirely visible yet, the presence of the \u201cRight Turn Only\u201d sign suggests this lane may be dedicated for right turns.\n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - The roadway markings for the left two lanes more clearly read \u201cONLY,\u201d matching the overhead signage indicating left\u2010turn lanes.  \n   - The right lane\u2019s pavement marking likewise reads \u201cONLY,\u201d and the roadside sign again shows a right\u2010curved arrow. This strongly suggests the rightmost lane is a \u201cright turn only\u201d lane.\n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - We now clearly see a large curved arrow on the right lane\u2019s pavement (pointing right), along with the word \u201cONLY.\u201d  \n   - The lane to the left of it has different arrow markings (not simply a right arrow). The signage on the right side of the road still indicates a mandatory right turn for this lane.\n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The same pattern continues: the right lane\u2019s marking is a large right arrow followed by \u201cONLY.\u201d  \n   - No signage or road marking shows that going straight, left, or making a U\u2010turn from this lane is allowed.\n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - From the final approach, the right arrow plus \u201cONLY\u201d marking on the right lane is unmistakable.  \n   - The other lanes are marked for other movements (left-turn lanes, or through lanes to the left), but the lane the ego vehicle occupies has consistent right\u2010turn\u2010only markings.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAll frames confirm that the lane in which the dashcam (ego vehicle) is traveling is designated solely for turning right. Signs and pavement markings repeatedly show a right arrow labeled \u201cONLY,\u201d with no indication of permissible straight, left, or U\u2010turn maneuvers.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- A. Go straight only \u2013 Contradicted by the clear right\u2010turn\u2010only arrows and signage.  \n- B. Turn left only \u2013 Contradicted by the right\u2010turn\u2010only arrows and signage.  \n- C. Turn right only \u2013 Matches the visible \u201cRIGHT TURN ONLY\u201d messages on signs and pavement.  \n- D. U\u2010turn only \u2013 No such indication; markings show a right arrow, not a U\u2010turn.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
