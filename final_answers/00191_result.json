  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The flatbed truck is ahead, occupying the **left lane** (the white lane line appears to its right). It is centered without obvious drift, and no turn signal is visible.  \n2. **Frame 2**: Truck remains squarely in the left lane; still no sign of the tires edging onto the lane divider or a flashing indicator.  \n3. **Frame 3**: A closer look confirms its trailer tracks in the same lane. The truck\u2019s cab is not angled toward the right.  \n4. **Frame 4**: No lane\u2010change signal or lateral movement is apparent. The gap in front of our vehicle remains roughly the same.  \n5. **Frame 5**: The truck continues straight in its lane, with no sign that it is crossing over or planning to.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 The truck stays fully in the left lane across all five frames.  \n\u2022 There is **no turn signal**, and the truck does not veer toward our lane.  \n\u2022 Because large trucks sometimes move wide, it is still prudent to give them extra space in case they do decide to change lanes unexpectedly; however, there is nothing in these frames to show a definite merge.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A. Yes definitely** \u2013 Not supported; there is no clear evidence (signal or lateral drift).  \n- **B. Possibly but we should yield to be safe** \u2013 Plausible. Although no strong cues of an imminent merge are visible, one might still drive defensively and be prepared.  \n- **C. No the adjacent truck is about to lane change behind us** \u2013 The truck is ahead, not behind, so this does not match the visuals.  \n- **D. No, there are no other vehicles in the scene** \u2013 Plainly incorrect; a truck is clearly visible.  \n\n**Best Answer**  \nB. Possibly but we should yield to be safe.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
