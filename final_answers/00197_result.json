  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   \u2013 The traffic signal facing the dashcam is red.  \n   \u2013 A dark sedan is visible off to the right, near the far curb.  \n   \u2013 No obvious motion of that dark sedan can be discerned here.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   \u2013 A red/burgundy sedan (different vehicle from the dark one on the right) is caught mid\u2010frame with noticeable motion blur.  \n   \u2013 Its long axis is oriented so that its front end appears to be farther left and its rear end to the right, indicating it is moving from the dashcam\u2019s left side toward the dashcam\u2019s right side.  \n\n3. **Frames 3, 4, and 5**  \n   \u2013 The dark sedan remains near the right\u2010side curb.  \n   \u2013 No other vehicles (besides the dark sedan, which does not appear to move) are prominent.  \n   \u2013 The red sedan seen in Frame 2 has already passed through the intersection and is no longer in view.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\n\u2022 The red traffic light for the dashcam\u2019s direction implies that cross\u2010traffic (the burgundy sedan) likely has the green.  \n\u2022 The burgundy sedan is the car that is clearly \u201cmoving\u201d in these frames. It traverses the intersection horizontally across the dashcam\u2019s field of view.  \n\u2022 Its front is to the left as it passes, so it is traveling left to right relative to the dashcam.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\nA. **Left to right.**  \n   \u2013 Matches the observed movement of the burgundy sedan across the intersection.  \n\nB. **Right to left.**  \n   \u2013 Contradicts the orientation of the moving car.  \n\nC. **Same direction as ego.**  \n   \u2013 The ego car is presumably waiting at a red light, so the moving sedan is crossing, not traveling the same way.  \n\nD. **Opposite direction from ego.**  \n   \u2013 Also not the case; it is crossing the intersection from left to right, not traveling head\u2010on toward the dashcam.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
