  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** On the far right, there is a green freeway\u2010style sign reading \u201cTo 5 South,\u201d mounted just above a stop sign at the intersecting side street. Although small in this frame, it appears to be oriented so that it would direct traffic to the right. The roadway ahead has \u201cSTOP\u201d painted on it, indicating an intersection is immediately ahead.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** The \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign and the stop sign on the right are larger in view, reaffirming that the freeway sign is located on that corner. Nothing suggests a left or straight path leads to I\u20105.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The intersection is clearly a cross street with stop markings in both lanes; the \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign remains positioned on the right corner.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** The black sedan ahead is angled slightly right, consistent with where we see the freeway sign. There is no corresponding signage directing left or straight to any I\u20105 on\u2010ramp.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** From this close\u2010up view of the intersection, no markings or signage indicate a left or straight path is needed for I\u20105 South. The only guidance for \u201cTo 5 South\u201d remains on that right corner.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll frames show the same \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign located at the right\u2010hand corner. Standard highway signage practice puts the arrow or sign on the side of the required turn. There is no competing sign for going straight or left to I\u20105.  \n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Left:** No sign or arrow suggests a left turn for I\u20105 South.  \n\u2022 **B. Straight:** There is no indication that continuing straight will enter I\u20105, and the \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign is not ahead.  \n\u2022 **C. Right:** The consistent presence of the \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign on the right side and its orientation strongly indicates a right turn.  \n\u2022 **D. Insufficient information:** The frames clearly show a \u201cTo 5 South\u201d sign at the right intersection, so there is enough information to conclude the correct direction.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
