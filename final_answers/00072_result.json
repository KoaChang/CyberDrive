  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   \u2013 The signal heads facing the dashcam appear dark (a common daytime appearance when the light is actually green).  \n   \u2013 No obvious red or yellow illumination is visible.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   \u2013 Still no bright signal indication, suggesting it remains green (the camera often makes a green light look \u201coff\u201d in bright daylight).  \n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   \u2013 Same situation: the overhead head for the ego lane looks dark/green.  \n   \u2013 Cross\u2010traffic signals are not controlling ego\u2019s movement.  \n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   \u2013 The main signal is still not showing a clearly lit color (still likely just turned yellow or about to turn).  \n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   \u2013 The overhead signal facing ego (now more visible to the right of center) shows a definite red glow.  \n   \u2013 Clearly, by the last frame, the light for ego\u2019s lane is red.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross the first three or four frames, the most likely \u201cdark\u201d color was in fact green. Then, between Frames 4 and 5, the signal transitions, and by Frame 5 it is clearly red. Standard signal phasing in this scenario (green \u2192 yellow \u2192 red) means what we actually observe in the five\u2010second clip is the tail end of that cycle, namely the light going from yellow to red just before Frame 5.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\nA. Green to yellow \u2013 We end up on red in Frame 5, so the change we see is not merely green turning to yellow.  \nB. Red to green \u2013 The signal is red only at the end, so it is not going from red to green.  \nC. Yellow to red \u2013 This matches the frames: after staying \u201cgreen\u201d (dark) for the first frames, it must have turned yellow briefly, then we see it red in the final frame.  \nD. Red to yellow \u2013 The light is clearly red at the end, so it never goes from red to yellow during the clip.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
