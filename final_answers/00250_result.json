  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The camera faces a signalized intersection at dusk. Ahead (straight ahead of the \u201cego\u201d vehicle) is a two\u2010lane roadway. On the far right side of the intersection, there is a vertical rectangular sign; though partially obscured, it appears white with black lettering.  \n\u2022 **Frames 2 & 3:** The same sign on the near\u2010right corner becomes a bit clearer. The top half of the sign seems to show \u201c30,\u201d consistent with a standard speed limit sign design (white sign, black numbers).  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** The sign is more noticeable; it has the general proportions of a typical speed limit sign. \u201c30\u201d is discernible as the posted speed.   \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** From this final angle, the \u201c30\u201d sign is plainly visible (albeit still partially blocked by a turning vehicle), confirming that it is indeed a speed limit sign, not a temporary or other road marking sign.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross frames, the sign\u2019s shape and placement (right side at an intersection) are consistent with a permanent regulatory speed limit sign. No other speed limit signs are visible contradicting it, and nothing suggests a school zone or special condition that might override 30 mph.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (25) \u2013 Nothing indicates a 25 mph school or residential zone.  \n\u2022 B (30) \u2013 Matches the posted numerical sign visible in multiple frames.  \n\u2022 C (35) \u2013 Not supported by the apparent posted sign.  \n\u2022 D (40) \u2013 Also not supported by evidence in the frames.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \nBased on the clearly visible \u201c30\u201d on the regulatory sign (Frames 2\u20135), the correct choice is:  \n\n<answer>30</answer>  ",
