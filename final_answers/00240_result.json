  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The yellow stripe and concrete barrier on the far left mark the outer edge of the roadway in the ego direction. We see one dashed white line separating the lane nearest the barrier from at least one lane to its right. It is not entirely clear yet whether there is a third lane beyond the black sedan on the right, but we do see enough space that suggests more than just two lanes.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** The white pickup and the black sedan occupy what appear to be two different lanes (left\u2010most and center). Again, there is an indication of another lane to the far right, but the camera angle still makes it a bit difficult to confirm.\n\n3. **Frame 3:** As traffic curves ahead, you can see more clearly that there is indeed a lane to the far right. The dashed lines and positions of vehicles show a left lane (where the truck is), a middle lane (the black sedan), and a right lane with other vehicles.\n\n4. **Frame 4:** This view reinforces that there are three lanes side by side in the ego direction: barrier/left lane, middle lane, and a confirmed third lane on the right (where additional cars are visible).\n\n5. **Frame 5:** The furthest frame shows the same three\u2010lane arrangement continuing forward. The barrier remains on the far left, there are two dashed lane\u2010divider lines (creating three lanes), and no indication of a continuous fourth lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross the frames, we see consistent evidence of three lanes traveling in the same direction: one next to the barrier on the left, one in the middle, and one on the far right. While there may be exit or on\u2010ramp activity, there is no sign of a bona fide fourth through\u2010lane.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- A (2 lanes) is too few, given the clear presence of a third lane on the right.  \n- B (3 lanes) fits each frame\u2019s markings and traffic flow.  \n- C (4 lanes) or D (6 lanes) would require more continuous lane lines/vehicles side by side, which are not visible.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is that there are three lanes traveling in the ego direction.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
