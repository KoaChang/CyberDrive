  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   \u2013 Large \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign is visible overhead.  \n   \u2013 White van ahead in the same lane as Ego.  \n   \u2013 A line of short white posts (\u201cbollards\u201d) separates a clearly\u2010marked bicycle lane from Ego\u2019s traveling lane.  \n   \u2013 Traffic signal for Ego\u2019s direction is green.  \n   \u2013 No cyclists appear to be _in_ Ego\u2019s lane; the cyclist lane is off to Ego\u2019s left, behind the bollards.\n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   \u2013 The \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign remains prominent.  \n   \u2013 A cyclist emerges in view, but they are in (or at) the bike lane/crosswalk area, not in Ego\u2019s lane.  \n   \u2013 Bollards still clearly separate the bike lane from Ego\u2019s lane.  \n   \u2013 Ego\u2019s signal is green.\n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   \u2013 Road markings reading \u201cLEFT\u201d or \u201cNO LEFT TURN\u201d are visible, reinforcing the prohibition on left turns.  \n   \u2013 The same cyclist is still in the bike lane area.  \n   \u2013 Green light remains for Ego\u2019s lane.\n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   \u2013 Another look at the cyclist near the crosswalk, well to the left of Ego\u2019s lane (separated by bollards).  \n   \u2013 The \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign is again in frame.  \n   \u2013 Ego\u2019s signal is still green.\n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   \u2013 Cyclist is paused at or entering the intersection from the bike lane/crosswalk.  \n   \u2013 Bollards remain in place to Ego\u2019s left; no bicycles are in Ego\u2019s actual automobile lane.  \n   \u2013 Traffic light for Ego\u2019s lane is green.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\n\u2022 The repeated \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d signage confirms that left turns are not permitted from Ego\u2019s lane.  \n\u2022 The presence of a separate, clearly\u2010delineated bike lane (and the fact that cyclists seen are using that lane or the crosswalk area) means they are _not_ occupying Ego\u2019s lane.  \n\u2022 Multiple frames show small vertical posts on Ego\u2019s left\u2014the bollards.  \n\u2022 The traffic signal heads facing Ego\u2019s lane are green throughout.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\nA. \u201cEgo is not allowed to turn left at this intersection.\u201d  \n   \u2013 True (supported by the large \u2018No Left Turn\u2019 signs).\n\nB. \u201cThere are bicyclists in ego\u2019s lane.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Not true. Cyclists are present, but in a _separate_ bike lane or crosswalk, not in Ego\u2019s traveling lane.\n\nC. \u201cThere are bollards to ego\u2019s left.\u201d  \n   \u2013 True; they are the short vertical posts separating the cycle lane.\n\nD. \u201cEgo\u2019s lane has a green light.\u201d  \n   \u2013 True, as seen in all frames where the light for Ego\u2019s direction is green.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
