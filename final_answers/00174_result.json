  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: The roadway has multiple lanes; the pickup ahead is in the same lane as ego. To the right is a clearly defined shoulder/lane boundary. There are no cones yet in view, and no immediate obstructions in ego\u2019s lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: Signs on the right start indicating upcoming exits. Still no cones in ego\u2019s lane. Pickup continues ahead in the same lane; no merging or lane\u2010closure arrows yet.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: More signage: \u201cAlpine Road, \u00be mile,\u201d and \u201cPalo Alto University Next Exit.\u201d The lane lines remain continuous, and the pickup stays in the same lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: Cones become visible on the right, suggesting work or a partial closure in or near the right lane/shoulder. Ego\u2019s lane appears unobstructed.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The cones line the right\u2010side lane/shoulder, guiding traffic away from the rightmost side. The pickup remains stable in the current (left\u2010center) lane; there is no sign that ego\u2019s lane itself is ending or must exit.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nThe coned area is off to the right (likely a closed exit/shoulder or work zone). There are no indications that the ego\u2010lane is forced off or merging. Stopping on a freeway lane is unwarranted unless there is an emergency. A lane change to the right would place ego into (or near) the coned/off\u2010ramp area. A lane change to the left is also not prompted by any hazard or sign telling us to move over.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Lane change to the left** \u2013 Not justified. The left lane is free, but there is no reason to move left.  \n\u2022 **B. Lane change to the right** \u2013 Inadvisable due to the cones and potential closure.  \n\u2022 **C. Continue in the current lane** \u2013 Safest action given the lane is open and unobstructed.  \n\u2022 **D. Come to a stop** \u2013 Not appropriate on a moving freeway with no immediate hazard.  \n\n**Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>  ",
