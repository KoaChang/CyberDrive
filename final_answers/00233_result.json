  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   \u2013 The ego\u2010vehicle is on a paved portion bounded on the right by a concrete construction barrier.  \n   \u2013 To the left of the ego\u2010vehicle\u2019s lane there is clearly another lane where at least one vehicle (a white pickup) is moving in the same direction. The center markings suggest a division between two lanes heading the same way.  \n   \u2013 Beyond the far left (grassy median and cones) appears to be either a turning lane or opposing traffic; however, that area is obviously separated from ego\u2019s two-lane roadway.\n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   \u2013 The black SUV traveling just left of the ego\u2010vehicle confirms the presence of a second forward lane.  \n   \u2013 The construction barrier on the right remains in place, ruling out a third lane on that side.\n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   \u2013 The black SUV continues straight ahead in what is clearly a separate left lane.  \n   \u2013 No additional lane markings appear on the right; the barrier still ends any possibility of more than two lanes in ego\u2019s direction.\n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   \u2013 The view downrange still shows only two lanes traveling forward: the lane with the black sedan ahead of ego and the lane occupied by the SUV to its left.\n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   \u2013 The roadway narrows at the construction zone on the right, with no evidence of a third lane.  \n   \u2013 Lane markings continue to confirm two forward lanes even as the intersection approaches.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nDespite the downtown/construction setting, the pavement markings and congruent vehicle positions across all frames confirm only two lanes in the ego\u2010vehicle\u2019s direction. The concrete barrier on the right removes any possibility of a third through\u2010lane, and the grassy or coned area on the far left is not open to through traffic.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (1 lane) is inconsistent with the clear second lane to the left.  \n\u2022 C (3 lanes) and D (4 lanes) do not match the visual evidence; there is no third or fourth lane open in the frames.  \n\u2022 B (2 lanes) aligns with what is visible in all frames.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
