  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** clearly shows a roadside sign with a left\u2010turn arrow labeled \u201cONLY,\u201d and on the pavement immediately in front of the camera there is a large painted arrow turning left.  \n2. **Frame 2** reconfirms the same left\u2010arrow \u201cONLY\u201d pavement marking in the camera\u2019s lane. You can also see the \u201cONLY\u201d sign (arrow pointing left) mounted near the signal head overhead.  \n3. **Frames 3\u20135** continue to show the same dedicated\u2010left\u2010turn signage and markings (that \u201cONLY\u201d arrow on both the roadway and on the signs). There are no markings or signs suggesting that this lane also allows going straight or right.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAll the signage and lane\u2010use arrows visible in these frames indicate the dashcam/ego vehicle is positioned in a dedicated left\u2010turn lane\u2014that is, the \u201cleft turn only\u201d lane. No pavement arrow or overhead sign suggests a combined left\u2010or\u2010straight movement is allowed from this lane. Adjacent lanes likely have different maneuvers, but from the ego\u2019s lane there is no indication of any option besides left turn.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 (A) Turn left only \u21d2 Matches the \u201cONLY\u201d signs and the pavement arrow in the ego lane.  \n\u2022 (B) Turn left and go straight \u21d2 Conflicts with the clear \u201cONLY\u201d left\u2010turn signs.  \n\u2022 (C) Go straight only \u21d2 Conflicts with the left\u2010turn\u2010only markings.  \n\u2022 (D) Turn right and go straight \u21d2 Conflicts with the left\u2010turn\u2010only markings.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
