  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1**: The median barrier on the far left separates oncoming traffic from the ego vehicle\u2019s side. Ahead of the ego vehicle is a black SUV. You can see two dashed white lane\u2010divider lines across the pavement on the ego\u2019s side, plus a solid white line on the far right marking the shoulder.  \n2. **Frame 2**: Again, only two dashed lines separate three total lanes on the ego\u2019s side. The lane to the far right is bounded by a solid white line (the shoulder).  \n3. **Frame 3**: The roadway layout is consistent\u2014still two dashed dividing lines on the ego\u2019s side, confirming three lanes in this direction.  \n4. **Frames 4 and 5**: The pattern remains unchanged; two dashed lines, one solid line to the right for the shoulder, and the median barrier to the left, indicating three lanes for the ego\u2019s direction.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\nBecause each dashed line represents a division between two adjacent lanes, two dashed lines on one side of the barrier mean there are three lanes traveling the same direction as the ego vehicle.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\nA single dashed line would indicate two lanes, whereas two definite dashed lines indicate three lanes. There is no evidence of a fourth lane (which would require a third dashed line), so the correct count is three.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
