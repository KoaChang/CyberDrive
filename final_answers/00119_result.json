  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The white sedan (Tesla) is stopped in the middle of a single through lane (double\u2010yellow line on its left). The brake lights are lit. Traffic appears to be backed up ahead. No obvious left\u2010turn lane or arrow is visible.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The sedan remains in the same position, still with brakes on. Oncoming traffic continues passing on the left, and the road to the right is bordered by a curb and walkway. No sign of the sedan angling left or occupying a designated turn bay.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The sedan\u2019s position and orientation are unchanged, and brake lights remain on. Nearby vehicles continue moving slowly on both sides, suggesting congested traffic.  \n4. **Frame 4:** Same situation\u2014no visible intersection sign or left\u2010turn arrow for the Tesla, and it is not angled to turn left. It simply remains behind a line of cars.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The sedan\u2019s brake lights are still lit, and it is still in the center of its lane. There is no clear indication of it turning or parking.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nNothing in any frame suggests the Tesla is parked on the shoulder or pulled off in a parking lane (Frame 1\u20135 show it squarely in the middle of the through lane). Nor is there evidence of a protected left\u2010turn signal or even an unprotected left turn\u2014no turn lane or signal appears. Instead, the Tesla is simply stopped behind other cars on a single through lane, indicative of waiting in traffic for the car(s) ahead to move.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\n\u2022 A (Parked): Unlikely, as the vehicle is in the live lane with brake lights on.  \n\u2022 B (Waiting for an unprotected left turn): No sign of the car angling left or a turn lane.  \n\u2022 C (Waiting for a protected left turn): No evident turn arrow or signal; traffic is moving slowly in front.  \n\u2022 D (Waiting for the car ahead to move off): Fits best, given the congestion and how the Tesla remains in line.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>D</answer>  ",
