  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1 & 2:** You can see the barrels and wide white diagonal markings in the left\u2010most portion, but no explicit \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign. Meanwhile, the center of the intersection ahead is filled with construction barrels/cones.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The cones become more apparent. They stretch across the middle lanes, indicating that going straight through is likely blocked. There is still apparent open space on the far left (potentially a ramp or turn) and on the far right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4 & 5:** The row of cones fully occupies the central lanes up ahead. Traffic is funneled either left or right, but not straight forward; there is no direct through\u2010lane open beyond the intersection.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll five frames show a consistent cone setup closing off the through\u2010lanes. Although there is a \u201cOne Way\u201d sign overhead, it does not equate to a no\u2010left\u2010turn prohibition. No signage forbids a right turn, and the right lane remains open. By contrast, the cones clearly barricade any attempt to continue straight.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) Straight \u2013 Coned off, blocked.  \n\u2022 (B) Left \u2013 Not obviously prohibited (no \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign and a usable path appears open).  \n\u2022 (C) Right \u2013 Not blocked.  \n\u2022 (D) None of the above \u2013 Incorrect, since going straight is in fact blocked.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>  ",
