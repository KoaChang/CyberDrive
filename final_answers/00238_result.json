  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n- **Frame 1**: The camera view shows a multi-lane roadway with a sign off to the right, though its details are not readable at this distance.  \n- **Frame 2**: As we draw nearer, the same sign on the right edge of the frame becomes more legible: it is a rectangular speed-limit sign. We can begin to make out the digits \u201c45\u201d on the sign.  \n- **Frame 3**: The sign is now clearly visible: \u201cSpeed Limit 45.\u201d This large, standard black-and-white sign is the most prominent indicator of the speed limit.  \n- **Frame 4**: The same sign remains in clear view, again confirming that the posted limit on this stretch of road is indeed 45 mph.  \n- **Frame 5**: Although the sign is now behind us, the roadway and other features appear consistent with a suburban arterial road that commonly carries a 45 mph limit.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\nAll frames show a relatively wide roadway with multiple lanes and a divider, and in Frames 2, 3, and 4 the \u201cSpeed Limit 45\u201d sign is plainly visible. There are no contradictory signs or indicators suggesting a different limit.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\n- A. 65 mph \u2013 Inconsistent with the sign reading \u201c45.\u201d  \n- B. 45 mph \u2013 Matches the posted sign visible in multiple frames.  \n- C. 35 mph \u2013 Contradicts the sign.  \n- D. 25 mph \u2013 Contradicts the sign and is also quite low for such a road.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer:**\nThe clear posting in the video frames indicates the speed limit is 45 mph.\n\n<answer>45mph</answer>",
