  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** We see multiple freeway lanes at night, with a green overhead sign reading \u201cBangerter Hwy \u00be Mile\u201d and \u201cExit 289\u201d to the upper right.  The sign includes a single right\u2010pointing arrow next to an \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d panel, suggesting one dedicated exit lane on the far right.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The camera advances, but the same overhead sign is clearer.  Only one arrow points toward the right lane, and \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d is still visible under that arrow.  No second arrow appears that would indicate another lane can peel off for Exit 289.  \n3. **Frame 3:** Again, the sign shows a single right\u2010turn arrow labeled \u201cExit 289,\u201d with an \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d banner.  The painted lane markings on the far right do not merge two lanes into the exit\u2014just that single far\u2010right lane leads off.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The same signage configuration is visible: a single arrow (far right) for Exit 289, with \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d underneath.  The second\u2010from\u2010right lane appears to continue straight, rather than splitting off.  \n5. **Frame 5:** Nothing changes about the sign indications: the rightmost lane is clearly the only lane marked to exit, and no additional overhead arrows or signage show a second lane exiting.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross all frames, the overhead sign consistently shows just one arrow designating the rightmost lane for Exit\u00a0289, marked \u201cEXIT ONLY.\u201d  The adjacent lane has no shared exit arrow.  Thus only one lane is actually able (and required) to take that exit.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 **A (1 Lane):** Matches the observation of a single \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d arrow/lane.  \n\u2022 **B, C, D (2, 3, or 4 Lanes):** Not supported by the signage; there is no indication that multiple lanes feed Exit\u00a0289.  \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe signage and lane striping show that exactly one lane can take Exit\u00a0289.  \n\n<answer>A</answer>",
