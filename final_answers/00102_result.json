  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - The lane in which the ego vehicle is traveling has its left boundary made up of two parallel, solid white lines. These lines look relatively close together and are more clearly white than yellow.  \n   - Other lanes to the right have normal dashed lane markings.\n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - Again, the left boundary of the ego lane appears as two solid white lines, continuing straight ahead.  \n   - It does not appear to be a single white line or any color other than white.\n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - The two white lines on the left boundary remain visible, neither interrupted nor merging into a single line.  \n   - These lines are typically used to mark restricted or HOV/express lanes, hence the \u201cdouble white lines.\u201d\n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - Continues the same pattern: two solid white lines on the left.  \n   - No sign of any single yellow line or no-lane-line scenario.\n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - The double white lines remain consistent as the left boundary of the lane. There are no changes in color or number of lines.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nOver all five frames, the left boundary consistently shows two solid white lines. On U.S. highways\u2014especially in states like California\u2014double white lines typically separate an HOV or express lane from general traffic. A single yellow line normally indicates a left-edge line separating opposing traffic (which this highway does not have here). \u201cNo lane lines\u201d clearly does not apply, and there are definitely two lines rather than one.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n- A. Single white line \u2192 Contradicted by observations: we see two lines, not one.  \n- B. Double white line \u2192 Matches exactly what\u2019s seen: two solid white lines on the left boundary.  \n- C. No lane lines \u2192 Not correct; the frames clearly show lines.  \n- D. Single Yellow Line \u2192 Incorrect color and quantity.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B. Double white line.</answer>",
