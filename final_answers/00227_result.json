  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** The street slopes uphill. Parked cars line both sides. A black sedan is parked on the right near a stop sign; its doors appear closed. A white pickup truck is moving downhill in our lane (toward the camera). No pedestrians or unusual obstructions appear.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The white pickup has moved closer; still no sign of the vehicles swerving or doors opening. The black sedan on the right remains parked with doors shut.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The white pickup just about passes by. Again, the black sedan on the right seems unchanged, and there is no pedestrian in our path.  \n4. **Frame 4:** Nearly the same scene\u2014cars parked in front of houses, no sudden lane changes or oncoming swerves. The black sedan\u2019s door is still closed.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The significant new development: the black sedan on the right now has its driver-side door open into the roadway, creating a sudden obstacle.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 Across the first four frames, no oncoming vehicle is veering out of its lane, no traffic signal is visible changing colors, and no pedestrian is dashing into the street.  \n\u2022 Only in the last frame do we see the black sedan\u2019s door swing open, which would be a hazard that the ego vehicle should watch out for.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. There is no evidence of an oncoming vehicle swerving.  \nB. No traffic light is shown changing to yellow.  \nC. There is no pedestrian jumping into the roadway.  \nD. An open car door on the right side appears in Frame 5.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>D</answer>",
