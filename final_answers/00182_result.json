  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis  \n\u2022 Frame 1: The camera faces an intersection where the traffic light is red. A crosswalk and stop line are visible, but no clear signs yet about turning.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: As the camera pans left, the side street appears clear; there is no visible construction or vehicle blocking that road.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: Overhead lines for transit are visible (likely trolley wires), and on the far right edge of the shot, there appears to be a traffic sign mounted on the pole, but it is partially obscured.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The same pole and sign line up more clearly at mid\u2010intersection: the sign is round, with an arrow pointing left and a red slash through it\u2014this is the standard \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign is in full view, confirming that left turns are prohibited at this intersection. There is no evidence of blocked roads, construction equipment, or railroad tracks; only the posted sign banning left turns.  \n\n2. Contextual Reasoning  \nCombining these frames, the decisive observation is the \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d prohibition sign that becomes increasingly clear in Frames 4 and 5. Nothing else in the images suggests the side street is blocked or that it\u2019s a railroad.  \n\n3. Match to Answer Choices  \nA) A no left turn sign \u2013 Matches what we see (a circular sign with a left arrow crossed out).  \nB) Road blocked by construction \u2013 No sign of barricades or excavation.  \nC) Road blocked by a vehicle \u2013 Streets appear open, with normal traffic.  \nD) The road to the left is a railroad \u2013 Overhead trolley/bus cables are present, but there\u2019s no evidence of an actual rail line blocking the road.  \n\n4.
