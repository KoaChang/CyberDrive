  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The camera faces a wide multi\u2010lane roadway. Vehicles are in both directions. A crosswalk spans the lanes, and at the right edge in the distance, there appears to be a sign but it is not fully legible at this angle.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: Slightly farther along, with fewer vehicles blocking a clearer view. There is still a \u201c30\u201d on a sign visible in the distance (on the right).  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The speed\u2010limit sign to the right is now more apparent and shows \u201cSpeed Limit 30.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The sign stands out more clearly, reading \u201c30\u201d and \u201cRadar Enforced.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The sign is fully legible: \u201cSpeed Limit 30 \u2013 Radar Enforced.\u201d\n\nContextual Reasoning:\nAcross frames 1 to 5, the most notable repeated sign is the \u201cSpeed Limit 30\u201d sign (especially clear in frames 3 to 5). There is no other speed\u2010related signage indicating a different limit. This strongly suggests that the speed limit at this location is 30 mph.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\n\u2022 A (35 mph) \u2013 No evidence of 35 mph signage.  \n\u2022 B (30 mph) \u2013 Consistently matches the visible \u201cSpeed Limit 30\u201d signs.  \n\u2022 C (25 mph) \u2013 No signage indicates 25 mph.  \n\u2022 D (45 mph) \u2013 No signage or context suggests such a high limit.\n\nProvide the Best Answer:\n<answer>B</answer>",
