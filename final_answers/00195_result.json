  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The roadway is a two\u2010way residential street with cars parked along both curbs. In the middle distance, a fire truck is visible traveling toward us but not yet centered in the lane. Nothing else appears to be obstructing the lane at this point; however, it looks as though the truck may be slowing or positioning.  \n2. **Frame 2**: The fire truck is more clearly centered in its lane\u2014still moving toward the ego vehicle\u2014but we can see it more prominently now. The lane markings remain standard; no special turn arrows are observed here.  \n3. **Frame 3**: The fire truck has nearly stopped or is creeping forward, possibly preparing to respond to an emergency. We see a man on the right sidewalk, and there is still open roadway ahead. No immediate reason for honking or accelerating; however, the fire truck\u2019s presence is becoming more significant.  \n4. **Frame 4**: Another emergency vehicle (red ambulance) appears up ahead, angled partway into the street. It now looks as though the road may be obstructed by these emergency vehicles.  \n5. **Frame 5**: The ambulance is blocking much of the roadway, essentially perpendicular to normal traffic flow. The fire truck is right in front of us, and the ambulance spans the lane further ahead, making normal passage impossible.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the frames, it becomes clear that there is an emergency response situation unfolding: the fire truck is slowing or stopping, and by the final frame, an ambulance is physically blocking the roadway. Standard traffic rules dictate yielding to emergency vehicles and not interfering with their operations. Accelerating or honking would be inappropriate; continuing straight \u201cnormally\u201d is not feasible because the ambulance is essentially blocking the lane. The only correct, safe, and lawful action is to stop or pull over and wait until the emergency vehicles have cleared or the responders indicate one may proceed.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A. Continue driving straight normally**: Not possible or safe, because the ambulance is obstructing the roadway and emergency personnel are attending to a call.  \n- **B. Stop or pullover**: Correct, as one must yield to emergency vehicles and not interfere; pulling over or stopping is the standard response.  \n- **C. Accelerate**: Unsafe and illegal in the presence of an active emergency scene ahead.  \n- **D. Honk**: There is no justification to honk at emergency vehicles that clearly have right\u2010of\u2010way.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>",
