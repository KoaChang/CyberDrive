  "answer": "Step 1: Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis  \n\u2022 Frame 1: Shows the roadway ahead, with a double yellow centerline and a left\u2010turn arrow marking in the left lane. No clearly visible speed limit sign in this frame.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: A speed limit sign is plainly visible on the right side of the road; it reads \u201cSpeed Limit 30.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The same sign remains in view, confirming \u201cSpeed Limit 30.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frames 4 and 5: The camera\u2019s perspective continues up the road, but no other speed limit signs are seen. The pertinent sign is still visible off to the right in Frame 4.\n\nStep 2: Contextual Reasoning  \nAlthough it is often wise to watch for changing speed zones in a sequence of dashcam frames, in this case the posted speed limit sign in Frames 2 and 3 clearly indicates 30 mph. There is no contradictory signage in subsequent frames, and the roadway does not obviously transition to a different speed zone (for example, from a commercial district to a highway).\n\nStep 3: Match to Answer Choices  \n\u2022 A (25 mph): Contradicted by the \u201c30 mph\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 B (30 mph): Matches the observed \u201cSpeed Limit 30\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 C (35 mph) and D (55 mph): Also contradicted by the posted \u201c30 mph\u201d sign.  \n\nStep 4: Provide the Best Answer  \nThe visible sign in the frames shows that the correct speed limit on this road is 30 mph.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
