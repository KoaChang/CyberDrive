  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The gray car is traveling in the center of its lane, heading straight. No immediate signs of turning.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** Still in the same lane, with no marked change in direction.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** Car continues forward; it is approaching an intersection.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** The car has now begun to cross the double yellow center lines. It is angled left, indicating a turn across oncoming lanes.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The car is fully in the intersection and clearly oriented to the left, moving onto a side street rather than reversing direction. This rules out a U\u2010turn and shows it is executing a left turn.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom frame to frame, we see the car go straight until it reaches the intersection. Then it begins to cross the center lines well enough to confirm a left turn onto the crossing street (rather than simply pulling over or making a U\u2010turn).  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A. Emergency pull over \u2192 Not supported; the car does not stop on the shoulder.  \n\u2022 B. Right turn \u2192 Incorrect; the car is moving across the yellow lines to the left.  \n\u2022 C. Left turn \u2192 Matches the observed continuous leftward path through the intersection.  \n\u2022 D. U-turn \u2192 The car does not pivot entirely back in the opposite direction; it proceeds into the left cross street.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
