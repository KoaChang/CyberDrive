  "answer": "<analysis>\n\nBelow is a worked\u2010through explanation showing why the lone through\u2010lane is the left lane, with the right lane marked as turn\u2010only.\n\n</analysis>\n\nFrame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f1 & 2:  \n  \u2013 Two main lanes appear in the driver\u2019s direction. Road markings are not yet very clear at a distance, but you can see the dashed center line solidly dividing what look to be two through lanes.  \n  \u2013 No obvious \u201cONLY\u201d text is visible yet, so it is too soon to conclude each lane\u2019s destination (straight or turn).\n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f3 & 4:  \n  \u2013 A white regulatory sign emerges on the left side with two separate arrows (one curving left, one going straight). This sign typically indicates the left lane is associated with left\u2010turn movement (arrow curving) and the right lane is for traveling straight (the upward arrow). However, because it is a single sign with two separate arrows, it most often denotes \u201cone lane for left turns\u201d and \u201canother lane for straight\u201d rather than a single lane that can do both.  \n  \u2013 Meanwhile, ground markings still are not fully legible in these frames, so the definitive \u201cturn\u2010only\u201d marking is not yet obvious.\n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f5 (most revealing):  \n  \u2013 The right lane has large white pavement text \u201cONLY\u201d and a turn arrow. This means the right lane is right\u2010turn\u2010only at the intersection.  \n  \u2013 The left lane does not show any \u201cONLY\u201d marking. In the absence of a \u201cLEFT ONLY\u201d marking (or any additional sign specifically forbidding going straight), traffic convention is that this left lane continues straight (and likely also permits left turns if needed).\n\nContextual Reasoning:\n\nBy the final approach (Frame\u202f5), the pavement clearly shows \u201cONLY\u201d in the right lane with a right\u2010turn arrow. Since that lane must turn right, the only lane from which you can legally continue straight is the left lane.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\n\n\u2022 A (0 lanes straight) is inconsistent with standard lane usage\u2014there is plainly a left lane that continues through.  \n\u2022 B (1 lane straight) matches the evident markings: the left lane is unmarked as \u201cONLY\u201d and therefore serves through traffic, while the right lane is a \u201cright\u2010turn\u2010only.\u201d  \n\u2022 C (2 lanes straight) is contradicted by the \u201cONLY\u201d marking in the right lane.\n\nThus, the best single answer is that there is one lane (the left lane) from which you can proceed straight.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
