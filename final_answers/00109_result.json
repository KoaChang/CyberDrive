  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The bus is traveling downhill in the same central travel lane as the ego vehicle. The street appears straight, with parking on both sides. No visible turn signals or lane markings suggest a required turn. No signage indicates a forced left or right.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The bus remains centered in the lane, continuing straight down the slope. Still no sign of lane\u2010changing or turning\u2014its position is consistent with going forward.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The bus proceeds downhill, no lateral movement toward a side street. There do not appear to be arrows on the pavement directing traffic to turn.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The bus is nearing the intersection but remains aligned with the lane\u2019s center. No visible turn signal or lane shift toward a left\u2010 or right\u2010turn position.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The bus keeps straight with no sign of initiation of a turn. The intersection has a stop sign, but nothing suggests the bus is about to turn left or right.\n\nContextual Reasoning:\nAcross all five frames, the bus holds its straight path in the travel lane. Buses typically follow main routes along the roadway. No turn signals or road markings hint at a turn, and no unusual maneuver such as reversing is indicated. The intersection ahead has a stop sign, but nothing suggests a pending turn or reverse action.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\n\u2022 Turn Left (A): No left\u2010turn signal or lane shift observed. Unlikely.  \n\u2022 Go Straight (B): The bus maintains a forward path, with no sign of turning. This is most consistent with the frames.  \n\u2022 Turn Right (C): No sign of a right\u2010turn signal or positioning. Unlikely.  \n\u2022 Reverse (D): No indication the bus is backing up.  \n\nProvide the Best Answer:\nThe bus is most likely continuing straight ahead.\n\n<answer>B. Go straight.</answer>",
