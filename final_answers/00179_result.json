  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The black sedan is centered in what appears to be the main through\u2010lane. Signs to the left mention \u201cRight Lane Must Exit,\u201d but the black sedan is not in that right\u2010most lane; it\u2019s in a lane to the left of the exit lane.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The black sedan remains in the same position relative to the lane markings and other roadway features\u2014no visible lateral movement left or right.  \n3. **Frame 3:** Still no sign of merging or turning; the sedan continues forward in the same lane. A raised divider (median) begins on the left, but the black sedan is to the right of it and remains in its lane.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The sedan\u2019s lane is clearly distinct from the exit lane to the right. No drift or turn into that lane; it continues straight ahead.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The black sedan has progressed forward without moving into any new lane, nor has it slowed or stopped to park. It remains in line with the same lane markings.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nOver the course of the five frames (roughly five seconds of driving), the black sedan does not show signs of shifting into the adjacent right lane or turning left. It simply travels straight ahead in the same through\u2010lane. There is no indication of parallel parking or pulling off, and the sedan does not appear to cross over any lane markings.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 (A) Making a left lane change.  \n  \u2013 No evidence the sedan moves left; it remains centered in its lane.  \n\n\u2022 (B) Making a right lane change.  \n  \u2013 The \u201cRight Lane Must Exit\u201d sign is visible, but the sedan does not merge into that exit lane.  \n\n\u2022 (C) Staying in lane.  \n  \u2013 Consistent with all five frames, where the sedan proceeds straight ahead in the same lane.  \n\n\u2022 (D) Parking.  \n  \u2013 No slowing, turn signal, or pulling off to park is apparent.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
