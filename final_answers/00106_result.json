  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**: The signal heads in the distance glow with a warm/amber hue rather than the bright green or red one might expect. This suggests the light is on its \u201cyellow\u201d phase (nighttime video often makes green lights look more yellowish\u2010white, but these are distinctly amber, not the characteristic green).\n2. **Frame 2 & 3**: The same amber\u2010colored indication persists; no bright red or distinct green is visible. The queue in front continues to slow/creep forward, which fits with drivers approaching a soon\u2010to\u2010end phase rather than accelerating on a fresh green.\n3. **Frame 4**: Suddenly we see the signal heads clearly shining bright red.  \n4. **Frame 5**: The signals remain red; vehicles are fully stopped/queued.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the first three frames show a warm\u2010colored/yellow indication and then the last two frames show the solid red lights, the most logical interpretation is that the traffic signal went from yellow to red during these few seconds. There is no evidence of a green phase in the early frames, nor do we see it switching from red to green.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (\u201cNo transition\u201d) is incorrect because the signal clearly changes color in Frame 4.  \n\u2022 B (\u201cGreen to yellow\u201d) is not supported by the warm amber color in Frames 1\u20133 and the switch to red thereafter.  \n\u2022 C (\u201cYellow to red\u201d) fits perfectly, as the light starts amber and is fully red by Frames 4 and 5.  \n\u2022 D (\u201cRed to green\u201d) is contradicted by the fact that we end on a red light, not begin on it.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
