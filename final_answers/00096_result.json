  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The roadway is clear of foot traffic. Large trucks are parked on the left and right side; no pedestrians are in the crosswalk.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: Still no pedestrians visible in the crosswalk. Same trucks on either side.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: Two people have begun stepping into the crosswalk area\u2014one wearing a safety vest, the other in a white shirt.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: A third person (in a light\u2010colored shirt) joins them in the crosswalk, so now three individuals are visibly crossing.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: All three continue walking together across the crosswalk in front of the camera\u2019s vehicle.  \n\nContextual Reasoning:  \nThe key change occurs between Frames 2 and 3, where pedestrians suddenly appear. By Frame 4, it is clear that three distinct individuals are crossing, and all remain visible in Frame 5.  \n\nMatching to Answer Choices:  \nOnly one choice aligns with seeing exactly three people crossing the road in front of the camera, which is \u201cC. 3.\u201d  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
