  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: The white car appears to be in the rightmost lane. A large sign in the median shows a split or \u201cY\u201d arrow, but the white car is nowhere near crossing that median or moving to the left lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The white car continues straight ahead in the same right lane. No obvious lateral movement.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Still in the right lane, maintaining a similar distance from the lane markings on its left.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The vehicle remains in the same position relative to the right curb/sidewalk. No visible deviation into any adjacent lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The white car again appears in the same rightmost lane, with no evidence of a crossover.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all five frames, the white car does not appear to shift its lateral position relative to lane lines or the curb. The question asks specifically whether the white car changed lanes. Based on these frames, it remains in its right lane the entire time.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) No lane change.  \n\u2022 (B) Lane change to the left.  \n\u2022 (C) Lane change to the right.  \n\u2022 (D) No white car in the scene.\n\nSince the white car is present and consistently in the right lane with no visible weaving or lateral shift, (A) \u201cNo lane change\u201d is the only answer consistent with the footage.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
