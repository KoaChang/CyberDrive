  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n\u2022 **Frame 1**  \n  The camera looks uphill toward a set of\u202fstandard traffic signals.  The signals appear to be lit in solid (non\u2010flashing) modes (e.g., one is orange), and there is also a sign on the right advertising a local business.  Nothing yet clearly identifies any flashing beacons.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 2**  \n  The same overhead traffic signals (still solid, non\u2010flashing) are seen, and buildings along the road become a bit more visible.  No additional lights are evident as flashing.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 3**  \n  A \u201cSchool Speed 20\u201d overhead sign and its associated round amber lights begin to come into clearer view.  Traffic signals on the left are standard red/yellow/green lights; the two small round beacons on the school\u2010zone sign appear to be the style used for flashing warnings.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 4**  \n  The Jeep passes to the left, and we have an even better look at the \u201cSchool Speed 20\u201d sign above the roadway.  At either side of the sign is a single round amber beacon that typically flashes when the school\u2010zone speed limit is in effect.  These two beacons are distinct from the standard (non\u2010flashing) traffic signals.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 5**  \n  Most clearly shows the rectangular \u201cSchool Speed Limit 20 When Flashing\u201d sign, with **one round amber light on each side** (left and right).  Both are illuminated in what is presumably their flashing mode.  Only those two beacons are flashing; the regular traffic signals (the three\u2010lens signals) are not.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning and Matching to Choices**  \nBecause the standard overhead traffic lights are solid red/yellow/green and do not flash, the **only flashing lights** in view are the two small round amber beacons attached to the school\u2010zone sign.  Thus, there are clearly **two** flashing bulbs overall.\n\n<answer>B. 2</answer>",
