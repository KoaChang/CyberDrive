  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1.**  \n   - Over the signal head is a permanent lane\u2010use sign, but farther ahead\u2014where the construction barrels begin\u2014signs read \u201cLEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\u201d and \u201cONLY\u201d (with a right\u2010turn arrow).  \n   - Large orange barricades block the straight\u2010ahead portion of the roadway; a cement truck and additional cones sit beyond them.  \n   - Net effect: the straight path is coned off, and the temporary signs force left\u2010lane traffic left and right\u2010lane traffic right.\n\n2. **Frame 2.**  \n   - The same temporary signage is visible in essentially the same position.  The \u201cLEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\u201d sign and the \u201cONLY \u2192\u201d sign for the right lane are quite prominent.\n\n3. **Frame 3.**  \n   - No changes in the cone layout or position of the workers.  Barricades still span the center, preventing any through movement.\n\n4. **Frame 4.**  \n   - Again, the path straight ahead remains fully blocked by orange barrels and \u201cROAD CLOSED\u201d\u2013type barricades.\n\n5. **Frame 5.**  \n   - The lane closure is not lifted; the left lane must turn left, and the right lane must turn right.  There is no indication that any lane can continue straight.\n\n---\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAlthough there appears to be a permanent lane\u2010use sign near the traffic light (possibly showing a left or through arrow), the *construction\u2010zone* signage and barricades override it. The temporary signs explicitly assign each lane to turning movements only (left or right), and the forward path is barricaded. That leaves **no lane** for going straight.\n\n---\n\n**Matching to the Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 **A.** \u201cNo because there are no signs \u2026 that indicate ego\u2019s lane can go straight.\u201d  \n  \u2013 This is partly true (the temporary signs remove any straight option), but one might misread the older overhead sign as allowing a straight movement.  \n\n\u2022 **B.** \u201cNo because roadwork has closed the lane ahead.\u201d  \n  \u2013 This matches exactly what the cones, barrels, and \u201cmust turn\u201d signs show: the through\u2010lane is closed by construction, so you must turn either left or right.\n\n\u2022 **C.** \u201cNo because there is a one way sign.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The one\u2010way sign on the cross street does not by itself prohibit going straight here.\n\n\u2022 **D.** \u201cYes.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The temporary signs and barricades clearly disallow a straight movement.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe construction barrels and the \u201cLEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\u201d / \u201cONLY \u2192\u201d signs leave no through path; ego cannot legally or physically continue straight.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
