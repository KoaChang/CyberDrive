  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1 & Frame 2:** The camera is behind a black SUV in what appears to be a \u201cmain\u201d through\u2010lane. There is another lane to the right, but no clear signage yet.  \n2. **Frame 3:** Construction barriers on the right become more evident, suggesting some lane reconfiguration. Still no visible \u201cmust turn\u201d markings.  \n3. **Frame 4:** A sign on the right says \u201cRIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT.\u201d No comparable sign for the left lane is visible, so the left (or center) lane(s) presumably can proceed straight.  \n4. **Frame 5:** The \u201cRight Lane Must Turn Right\u201d sign is even clearer. There is no indication that the left lane(s) are forced to turn left.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nSince the only posted restriction is on the right lane (\u201cmust turn right\u201d), at least one lane to its left is free to continue straight. There is no signage forcing the left or \u201cmiddle\u201d lane to turn left. It therefore appears that two lanes\u2014everything except the far right lane\u2014are allowed to continue straight on through the intersection.\n\n**Matching to the Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 (A) \u201cThe left two lanes\u201d matches the signage: the right lane must turn right, so the remaining two lanes (left and center) can go straight.  \n\u2022 (B) \u201cThe right two lanes\u201d conflicts with the \u201cRight Lane Must Turn Right\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 (C) \u201cAll the lanes\u201d also conflicts with the \u201cRight Lane Must Turn Right\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 (D) \u201cThe middle lane\u201d alone is too restrictive; there is no sign preventing the left lane from going straight as well.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
