  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: We see a \u201cSTOP\u201d marking in the lane and a directional arrow pointing right. To the far right, there is a rectangular sign posted up ahead\u2014though partially small at this point, it appears to be a speed limit sign.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The same sign on the right is more visible: it looks like a standard black-and-white \u201cSpeed Limit\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: The sign is clearer: it reads \u201c35.\u201d  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: Again, the posted speed limit sign, clearly showing \u201c35,\u201d is seen to the right shoulder of the road.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The same sign is still visible, confirming that the numeric limit is \u201c35.\u201d\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll the frames consistently show the same speed limit sign on the right side of the roadway. It is a standard rectangular sign with the number \u201c35,\u201d which strongly indicates that the current road\u2019s speed limit is 35 mph.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) 25 mph \u2013 No supporting evidence; the visible sign reads \u201c35.\u201d  \n\u2022 (B) 30 mph \u2013 Same as above, no sign supporting 30 mph.  \n\u2022 (C) 35 mph \u2013 This matches the posted speed limit sign seen in multiple frames.  \n\u2022 (D) 40 mph \u2013 No sign matches 40 mph in the frames.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
