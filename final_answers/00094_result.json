  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The truck is centered in its lane on a two\u2010lane (double\u2010yellow center) road. The intersection is still a fair distance ahead. No turn signals or brake lights are distinctly visible.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The truck continues straight, still near the middle of its lane, with an intersection and a stop sign dimly visible up ahead on the right.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The intersection area looks more defined. The truck appears slightly right of center but not definitively turning yet.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The truck has shifted more to the right side of its lane, close to the intersection with a visible stop sign. This suggests the driver may intend to turn right (especially given how trailers often swing a bit wide).  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The truck\u2019s cab and trailer are angled toward the right side of the intersection where the stop sign is located; it clearly looks poised for a right turn.\n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:\n\nOver the five seconds, the truck progresses from centered in the lane to positioning itself to the right, lining up with the visible stop sign at an intersection. Large trucks frequently have to swing wide, even for right turns, which matches the shift seen in the final frames. There is no indication of a left turn (no leftward drift across the center line) or continued straight path (the truck is clearly hugging the right).  \n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:\n\n\u2022 A (Left) is inconsistent with the fact that the truck has positioned itself to the right side of the lane.  \n\u2022 B (Straight) is contradicted by the truck moving close to the right edge of the lane at a stop sign, typically where a driver would set up for a right turn.  \n\u2022 C (Right) matches the visual evidence of the truck\u2019s lane positioning and alignment with the right side.  \n\n4.
