  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - We can see three overhead signal \u201cheads\u201d facing us.  One is paired with a \u201cLEFT ONLY\u201d sign (so it controls a dedicated left\u2010turn lane), and one appears over what is presumably the through lane.  Farther to the right is a third signal near a right\u2010turn arrow sign.  All three are showing red here.  \n   - Additional lights or signs off to the sides (for cross\u2010traffic or side roads) do not govern our forward approach.\n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - The same three primary signals remain clearly visible and red.  The SUV turning left is moving under the left\u2010turn signal head.  No new signal heads appear for our lanes.\n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - Again, three main overhead red indications: one for left\u2010turn\u2010only, one for through (center lane), one near the right\u2010turn arrow.  \n   - The smaller fixtures you can see in the distance control the cross street, not our approach.\n\n4. **Frames 4 and 5:**  \n   - The signals remain in the same positions, still showing three distinct overhead red lenses for our approach.  \n   - None of the other lights visible control the lane(s) the dashcam/\u201cego\u201d vehicle is in.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBecause there is a dedicated left\u2010turn lane (with its own overhead signal and \u201cLEFT ONLY\u201d signage), and a right\u2010turn arrow with its own overhead signal, we already have two separate signals for these turning movements.  A third overhead signal governs the through lane(s).  While there may be additional signal heads controlling cross traffic or side roads, they do not \u201capply\u201d to this approach of the intersection.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A (2) or D (5)** do not match the clear presence of three separate signals for left, through, and right.  \n- **C (4)** would typically require there to be a second through\u2010lane signal or some other fourth signal explicitly governing our lane, which does not appear here.  \n- **B (3)** matches exactly the three overhead signals that control the dashcam vehicle\u2019s approach (left\u2010only, through, and right\u2010turn).\n\n**Best Answer**\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
