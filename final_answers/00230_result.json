  "answer": "1) Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis\n\n\u2022 Frame 1 and Frame 2: The ego is queued in traffic, approaching a multi\u2010lane city intersection. Overhead signals include arrows and \u201cONLY\u201d signage for each lane. Although multiple vehicles are ahead, it appears the ego is to the right of the through\u2010traffic lane.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The overhead signals become clearer, showing separate lanes designated \u201cONLY\u201d for left turns, straight\u2010through travel, and right turns. The ego\u2019s lane seems aligned with the right\u2010turn\u2010only signage.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The pavement marking directly in front of the camera shows a large right\u2010arrow with \u201cONLY,\u201d confirming that this lane must turn right.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The same right\u2010turn\u2010only marking is fully visible. No lane markings or signs suggest the ego may legally go straight or left; the only permissible maneuver is turning right.\n\n2) Contextual Reasoning  \nBecause the pavement arrow and overhead sign both dictate a right turn only, and there is no indication that traffic or signage would force an immediate stop (beyond a routine red\u2010light stop), the lane choice and signage make turning right the imminent action.  \n\n3) Match to Answer Choices  \nA (Turn left) and B (Go straight) conflict with the \u201cRight\u2010turn\u2010only\u201d lane markings. D (Stop) might occur briefly if the signal is red, but the question asks for the ego\u2019s \u201cimmediate most likely action\u201d in terms of direction/maneuver; that would be turning right once permitted.  \n\n4) Provide the Best Answer  \nTurning right is the only lane\u2010compliant maneuver.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
