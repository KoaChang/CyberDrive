  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** It is nighttime; the road surface appears highly reflective, and numerous \u201chotspots\u201d of reflected streetlights show that the pavement is wet. Subtle streaks on the camera\u2019s view suggest active rain droplets on the windshield or lens.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The street still looks glossy with steady reflections, and light flares around car headlights and streetlamps hint at moisture in the air.  \n3. **Frame 3:** Same wet roadway conditions; the gloss on the road is consistent, indicating ongoing rainfall or a just\u2010wet surface.  \n4. **Frame 4:** A noticeable \u201cspray\u201d or watery distortion in front of the camera is visible, supporting the idea that water is hitting the windshield or being splashed up, actively confirming it is raining rather than just wet from a prior rainfall.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The final frame continues to show a shiny, rain\u2010covered road, with streaky lens effects.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all five frames, the dark setting plus the reflective road and water droplets/spatter strongly indicate active rainfall rather than merely overcast or post\u2010rain dampness. There is no evidence of snow accumulation or sunshine.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (Sunny) is clearly ruled out by the nighttime images and wet conditions.  \n\u2022 B (Snowy) is inconsistent with the wet roadway (no slush, snow piles, or accumulation).  \n\u2022 C (Overcast) could explain cloudy nighttime, but the visible droplets and spray strongly favor active precipitation.  \n\u2022 D (Raining) best matches the large wet reflections, the droplets on camera, and the water spray in the latter frames.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
