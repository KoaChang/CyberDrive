  "answer": "1) Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis\n\n\u2022 Frame 1 & Frame 2:  \n  \u2013 The road begins curving gently to the left toward a major intersection with multiple lanes.  \n  \u2013 Signs are a bit distant but you can see at least two signal heads over the intersection (one for left\u2010turn arrows, one for through lanes).  \n\n\u2022 Frame 3:  \n  \u2013 More detail emerges: there appear to be at least four lanes approaching the intersection.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 4:  \n  \u2013 Large pavement markings become visible. You can see at least two lanes labeled \u201cONLY\u201d with curved arrows (indicating left\u2010turn\u2010only lanes).  \n  \u2013 The right\u2010most of those two \u201cONLY\u201d lanes is the second lane from the left.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 5:  \n  \u2013 The markings are clearest here: the two left\u2010most lanes each say \u201cONLY\u201d with left\u2010turn arrows. The remaining lanes to the right appear to be for going straight or possibly turning right.  \n  \u2013 Thus, Lane 1 and Lane 2 are both \u201cleft turn only,\u201d Lane 3 and Lane 4 continue or turn another direction.  \n\n2) Contextual Reasoning\n\nBecause the ego driver must make a left turn at this intersection and then \u201cimmediately\u201d make a right turn afterward, the most sensible choice is to pick the right\u2010most lane that still allows a left turn. That reduces the need for sudden lane changes in the intersection\u2019s cross street.\n\n3) Match to Answer Choices\n\n\u2022 Lane 1 (far left) would leave the vehicle in the left\u2010most position on the cross street, complicating a quick right turn.  \n\u2022 Lane 2 is also a left\u2010turn lane but is farther to the right, making it easier to set up the subsequent right turn.  \n\u2022 Lanes 3 and 4 appear to be through (and possibly right\u2010turn) lanes at this intersection, so you cannot turn left from those.  \n\n4) Provide the Best Answer\n\nLane 2 is the right\u2010most lane that permits a left turn, which best enables an immediate right turn afterward.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
