  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: Looking straight ahead, one can see a \u201cNO TURN ON RED\u201d sign overhead. To the right, just beyond the bus shelter, there is a rectangular sign reading \u201c25.\u201d  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The same sign remains visible on the right side, with \u201c25\u201d indicating a speed limit.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: No new signs contradict the posted \u201c25\u201d sign on the right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The \u201cSpeed Limit 25\u201d sign is plainly visible to the right, near the bus stop.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: Again, the \u201c25\u201d sign can be seen on the upright post next to the bus shelter.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll five frames consistently show a speed\u2010limit posting of \u201c25\u201d on the right side of the roadway. There are no other speed\u2010limit signs shown that would override or contradict this.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) 35, (B) 30, and (D) 45 all conflict with the clearly posted signage.  \n\u2022 (C) 25 is supported by the clear speed\u2010limit sign in the video frames.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe posted speed limit relevant to the ego vehicle is 25 mph.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
