  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - You can see one dashed white line running roughly down the middle of the road and another dashed white line further right, with a solid white line at the far right edge.  \n   - This suggests one lane to the left of the center dashed line, one \u201cmiddle\u201d lane between the two dashed lines, and then a third lane to the right of the second dashed line (before the solid white shoulder boundary).  \n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - The same three distinct dashed/solid lane boundaries appear: one dashed line on the left, another dashed line in the middle, and a solid white line on the far right.  \n   - This again points to three clearly defined lanes.  \n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - The three interior lanes remain evident. The solid right edge line and the guardrail on the far left confirm that anything beyond those edges is shoulder or median.  \n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The road layout is consistent: the same three lanes continue, all with vehicles ahead traveling in the same direction.  \n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - No new lanes appear, and the rightmost area beyond the white edge line is clearly a shoulder or ramp taper, not a through lane.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all frames, the repeated pattern of two dashed white lines within the roadway, plus a solid boundary at the right\u2010hand shoulder, confirms that there are three lanes for through traffic in the same direction. The broader pavement at the far right is demarcated by a solid white stripe, typical of a shoulder boundary rather than a fourth travel lane.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- There is more than one lane (so not C).  \n- It is clearly more than two lanes (so not D).  \n- The roadway markings do not show four continuous through lanes (so B is not correct).  \n- Consistently, the markings show three drivable lanes going in the ego direction (A).\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
