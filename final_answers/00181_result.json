  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: From a distance, the overhead traffic signals appear illuminated at their top aspects, which typically indicates a red\u2010illuminated signal in the U.S. Traffic ahead also seems to be slowing or stopped.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The traffic light is more clearly red; no indication of a changing signal (e.g., no otherwise lit green or yellow). Cars in the oncoming lanes also appear in a stopped or near\u2010stopped formation.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Still approaching the same intersection, with the top light glowing red; surrounding traffic does not appear to be moving robustly through the intersection.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The signal remains red, with vehicles ahead continuing to move slowly or stop. No sign of it turning green or flashing yellow.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: Very near the intersection now. The red lights are plainly visible, and there\u2019s no indication of a turn arrow or anything that would permit going through.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll five frames show a consistent red light overhead. No frames suggest the light changes to green or yellow. The safe and lawful response when encountering a red traffic signal is to come to a complete stop.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Come to a complete stop.** Matches a red light requirement.  \n\u2022 **B. Proceed as if a green light.** Conflicts with the clearly red traffic signal.  \n\u2022 **C. Proceed with caution.** Typically relevant for flashing yellows or intersections lacking a clear right\u2010of\u2010way; but we have a red light here.  \n\u2022 **D. Speed up.** Violates traffic laws at a red signal.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A. Come to a complete stop.</answer>",
