  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame\u00a01: Looking ahead toward the intersection, there is already a circular sign on the right side near the traffic light showing a left\u2010arrow with a red slash, indicating \u201cNo Left Turn.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame\u00a02: As the camera view gets slightly closer, that same sign remains visible to the right of the traffic light.  \n\u2022 Frame\u00a03: The sign\u2019s shape and slash across the left\u2010arrow are more apparent. Traffic flow seems otherwise normal, with no evidence of road closures or blocked lanes.  \n\u2022 Frame\u00a04: The sign is still visible where the driver would be checking for turn permissions. There are no construction barriers or lane blockages in sight.  \n\u2022 Frame\u00a05: Still no construction activity or vehicles physically blocking a left turn (though the sign remains evident).\n\nContextual Reasoning:\n\nThe sequence of images shows no sign of construction crews or equipment blocking the road, nor any abnormally positioned vehicles that would physically prevent a left turn. Instead, a standard North American \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign is plainly visible, consistent in all frames.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\n\nA. Road is blocked by construction?  \n   \u2013 The frames do not show any construction cones, signs, or machinery.  \n\nB. Road is blocked by other vehicles?  \n   \u2013 The occasional traffic in the oncoming lane is typical city traffic, not a blockade.  \n\nC. There is a no left turn sign.  \n   \u2013 This is supported by the clear \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d signage shown to the right of the intersection.  \n\nD. None of the above.  \n   \u2013 Not true, because there is a prohibition sign.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
