  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** An overhead green freeway sign is visible to the right. It reads \u201cEXIT 240B \u2013 183 North \u2013 Lampasas \u2013 EXIT ONLY.\u201d  \n2. **Frame 2:** The same overhead sign remains clear, again indicating \u201cEXIT 240B.\u201d  \n3. **Frame 3:** The immediate overhead signs are now different (for \u201cI\u201035 North\u201d and \u201cSt. Johns Ave.\u201d), but the sign for 183/Lampasas has already been passed or is behind the camera position.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The camera continues forward on the highway, with signage for \u201cI\u201035 North\u201d and \u201c183.\u201d No new exit number for the Lampasas exit is visible, since it was shown earlier as 240B.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The roadway continues; no new signage contradicts the previously seen \u201cEXIT 240B\u201d sign.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross Frames 1 and 2, the central piece of evidence\u2014a large overhead sign\u2014explicitly shows \u201cEXIT 240B\u201d for \u201c183 North\u201d / \u201cLampasas.\u201d By Frame 3, that sign is no longer as prominent (the dashcam has moved past it), so the key information was captured in the first two frames.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A (230B) and C (250B) do not match the overhead signage.  \n- D (Insufficient information) is incorrect, because the frames clearly show \u201cEXIT 240B.\u201d  \n- B (240B) is consistent with the sign seen in multiple frames.\n\n<answer>240B</answer>",
