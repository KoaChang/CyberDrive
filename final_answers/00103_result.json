  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - The camera is looking straight ahead at an intersection under green lights.  \n   - Road markings ahead show multiple lanes, but from this angle it\u2019s not yet obvious which lane is for what purpose.  \n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - As the vehicles move through the intersection, we begin to see lane markings on the right. Still not entirely clear, but there appear to be large white letters on the pavement that might say \u201cBUS\u201d or something similar.  \n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - The right\u2010most lane is now more distinctly painted with \u201cBUS\u201d (and part of the word \u201cONLY\u201d), indicating it is a dedicated lane. There is also a shuttle or bus up ahead in that lane.  \n   - This is the first clear confirmation that the far right lane is not a standard travel lane for ordinary vehicles.  \n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The marking on the right lane says \u201cTAXI\u201d and/or \u201cBUS\u201d \u201cONLY.\u201d This strongly suggests the lane is reserved for public transport and/or taxis.  \n   - No large obstacle or sign indicating it\u2019s a shoulder, and there is no visible blockade in it; it\u2019s simply not for regular traffic.  \n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - The paint on the road leading forward reads \u201cBUS\u201d or \u201cTAXI ONLY,\u201d confirming that the lane remains restricted for authorized vehicles rather than general traffic.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nOver the course of these five frames, it becomes increasingly clear that the right\u2010hand lane is reserved for select vehicle types (bus, taxi, etc.). There is no sign of it being blocked by a major obstacle or being just a shoulder. The presence of another vehicle in the lane (a bus) does not in itself make a permanent barrier to changing lanes. Rather, the crucial point is that the lane markings indicate a special\u2010use lane not meant for private passenger cars. Hence, it would be inappropriate for the ego vehicle to move into that lane.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (Shoulder) \u2013 The lane is clearly marked \u201cBUS\u201d or \u201cTAXI\u201d; not a shoulder.  \n\u2022 B (Blocked by obstacle) \u2013 No large obstacle; the lane is being used by a bus, so it\u2019s open but restricted.  \n\u2022 C (Only for buses and taxis) \u2013 Matches the \u201cBUS ONLY\u201d / \u201cTAXI ONLY\u201d road markings we see.  \n\u2022 D (Currently occupied by another vehicle) \u2013 While a bus is there, mere occupation by another vehicle does not by itself forbid a lane change indefinitely. The key is that the lane is not permitted for general use.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
