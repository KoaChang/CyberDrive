  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1/2:** Well before the intersection, a \u201cRIGHT\u202fTURN\u202fONLY\u201d sign on the right shoulder clearly applies to the rightmost lane. The remaining lanes are not yet visibly marked, but we can see at least four or five lanes in total.  \n2. **Frame 3:** Traffic is stacking up across multiple lanes. The far right remains clearly marked (via signage) as a dedicated right\u2010turn lane.  \n3. **Frame 4:** Road\u2010arrow markings begin to come into view. The far\u2010left lane shows a large left\u2010curving arrow, indicating it is committed to turning left. The far\u2010right lane\u2019s pavement arrow confirms what the sign stated\u2014right turn only.  \n4. **Frame 5:** The same lane\u2010arrow markings are more evident. The leftmost lane still shows the large left\u2010turn arrow; the far\u2010right arrow is a right\u2010turn arrow. The three middle lanes have no exclusive\u2010turn markings or signage, so they can proceed straight.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 With a dedicated left\u2010turn lane on the far left and a dedicated right\u2010turn lane on the far right, the only lanes that support going straight are the three unmarked center lanes.  \n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n- A (5) and B (4) are too high, because at least one lane on each edge is turn\u2010only.  \n- D (2) is too few, because only *two* lanes would be eliminated by the left\u2010turn\u2010only and right\u2010turn\u2010only restrictions.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
