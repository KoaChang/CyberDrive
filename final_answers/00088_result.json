  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - We see the roadway and sidewalks at night, but no clear turn arrows or lane signs yet.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - The intersection is beginning to come into view. A signal light is visible, but still no definitive lane\u2010use markings are legible.\n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - A sign on the right shows two distinct turn arrows\u2014a left\u2010turn arrow and a right\u2010turn arrow\u2014above the word \u201cONLY.\u201d This strongly suggests that the lane referenced by that sign cannot proceed straight; it is solely for left or right turns.  \n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - The same \u201cONLY\u201d sign with a left\u2010arrow and right\u2010arrow is more clearly in view. Given typical road\u2010sign conventions, this layout means there is no room in that lane for going straight through the intersection; you must turn left or right.\n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - The intersection is directly ahead, and the sign is still in sight. No additional markings contradict the earlier observation. The bus ahead is turning left, and the car in front appears to be turning right\u2010\u2010further confirming that no through lane is present here.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\n\u2022 Because the prominent sign indicates turn\u2010only movements (left or right) and we see vehicles actually turning left and right, it appears to be a T\u2010intersection.  \n\u2022 No markings or signs allow a straight\u2010through movement.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\nA. **Left lane** \u2013 The signage and turning traffic both suggest the left lane must turn left, not go straight.  \nB. **Right lane** \u2013 The sign shows \u201cOnly\u201d left or right turns for this lane as well.  \nC. **Left and right lane** \u2013 Neither lane permits going straight, so this is incorrect.  \nD. **None of the above** \u2013 Correct, because both lanes shown are turn\u2010only, and going straight is not permitted.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
