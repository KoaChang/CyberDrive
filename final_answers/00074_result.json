  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - The cross\u2010traffic (left\u2010to\u2010right) has not really begun flowing in front of the camera yet. Most vehicles are either waiting at the far side of the intersection or just entering the intersection from the left edge.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - A light\u2010colored sedan at far left begins to move across in front of the camera. Other vehicles behind it are inching forward but have not fully entered the intersection yet.\n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - That same light\u2010colored sedan is now well into the intersection (roughly center\u2010frame) heading left to right. A white SUV and a few other vehicles (Jeep, additional sedan) are also moving in but are positioned farther to the left/rear.\n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - Multiple vehicles are mid\u2010intersection (the white SUV, a silver/gray sedan, a Jeep, etc.). The sedan that led the pack (visible in the previous frames near the center) has nearly cleared the intersection to the right.\n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - The first light\u2010colored sedan that started crossing in Frame 2 (and was near the right side by Frame 4) is no longer visible at all. By contrast, the white SUV, Jeep, bus, and a silver sedan are all still partly in view\u2014they have not fully exited the right edge of the frame.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nOnly one vehicle (that first light\u2010colored sedan) actually manages to cross fully in front of the camera and disappear from view by the end of Frame 5. All other crossing vehicles are still partially within the frame in the final shot.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (0) is incorrect because we do see one sedan fully exit.  \n\u2022 B (1) fits the observations: one sedan finishes its crossing and disappears.  \n\u2022 C (2) and D (3) are not supported by the frames; no second or third vehicle fully exits.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
