  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The oncoming sedan is visible in the opposite lane, moving toward the camera. There is no sign of it pulling over or slowing alongside parked cars (so it is not parked or preparing to park), nor does it appear stopped or reversing.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The same vehicle continues forward in the opposite lane. No turn\u2010signal indication is apparent, and it keeps a centered position rather than angling left.  \n3. **Frame 3:** As it approaches the intersection ahead, it remains in its lane, still oriented straight, without drifting toward any side for a turn.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The sedan progresses closer to the intersection, still centered in its lane and giving no visible sign (turn signal or lane change) of turning left.  \n5. **Frame 5:** By this point, the car is at or near the intersection but is still aligned as if to continue straight through rather than turning left or reversing.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all frames, the oncoming car is clearly moving forward in its lane. There is no evidence of braking, reversing lights, or a turn signal indicating a left turn. Neither is it parked along the curb. Hence, the most consistent conclusion is that it intends to proceed straight through the intersection.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Intends to go straight:** Best fits the observation that the oncoming sedan travels steadily in its lane with no turning or reversing maneuvers.  \n\u2022 **B. Will reverse:** Contradicted by continuous forward motion.  \n\u2022 **C. Is parked:** Contradicted by the fact that the car is moving.  \n\u2022 **D. Will turn left:** Contradicted by the vehicle\u2019s lane position and apparent lack of turn signal or lateral movement.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
