  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 The roadway appears to end at a perpendicular intersection. A large sign in the center median clearly shows a left\u2010turn arrow with a red slash through it (\u201cNo Left Turn\u201d). There is no marked through\u2010lane straight ahead\u2014just a raised median and buildings in front.  \n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 A pickup truck drives across the intersection left to right. The \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign remains prominent, and there is still no visible continuation straight.  \n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 Again, we see the same sign prohibiting a left turn. The intersection looks like a T\u2010junction, so the through path straight is blocked by the median.  \n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 Another vehicle crosses from left to right, reinforcing that ego\u2019s street tees into the cross street. The only evident open movement is rightward.  \n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 The \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign is very clear. There is no signage prohibiting a right turn, and no apparent roadway to continue straight.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**  \nBecause it is a T\u2010intersection with a \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign, the only remaining legal maneuver is to turn right. There is no through lane continuing forward, and left is expressly disallowed.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**  \n\u2022 A (Turn left) is explicitly prohibited by the posted sign.  \n\u2022 B (Turn right) is not prohibited and is indeed the only open turning option.  \n\u2022 C (Go straight) is not possible, as the roadway terminates at this intersection.  \n\u2022 D (Turn left and turn right) is incorrect, because turning left is disallowed.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
