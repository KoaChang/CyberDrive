  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - The traffic light directly above the lane where the blue vehicle is waiting shows two bright red lamps (i.e., a solid red phase).  \n   - To the left, there is also a matching red traffic signal.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - The situation remains generally the same; the main signal over the blue car is still solid red.  \n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - The main light is no longer illuminated (the red lamps have turned off, but the green hasn\u2019t yet come on). This typically happens briefly while the signals cycle; we see the lamp housing is dark, but no phase is lit.  \n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - Now the overhead signal has turned green (the left part of the signal has a bright green light).  \n   - The red pedestrian signal on the side remains lit for pedestrians, but the main traffic signal has changed from red to green.  \n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - The overhead light is still green, confirming the signal is in a steady green phase for traffic proceeding straight through.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom the first two frames, the traffic light is clearly solid red. By Frames 3 through 5, we see the signal cycle from showing no illumination (yellow was likely very brief if it occurred at all in this still capture) to a steady green phase. There is no indication in any frame that the light is blinking or flashing, and by the final frame it is plainly green.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A (Solid red) and B (Blinking red) fail because the last frames show the light has turned green, not remaining red.  \n- D (Blinking green) is not consistent with the typical appearance of a steady traffic light transition from red to green.  \n- C (Solid green) matches the final frames, which show a standard green indication, not flashing.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
