  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - Overhead sign shows two left\u2010turn arrows under \u201c183 North\u201d and \u201cLampasas,\u201d and two straight arrows under \u201c290\u201d and \u201cManor Rd.\u201d  \n   - Roadway appears to have four main through lanes (plus the paved shoulder on the left).  \n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - Signage is clearer: the left side of the overhead sign (labeled \u201c183 North / Lampasas\u201d) has two left arrows, while the right side (labeled \u201c290 / Manor Rd\u201d) has two straight\u2010ahead arrows.  \n   - A \u201cLEFT LANE MUST ENTER RAMP\u201d warning sign is also visible on the roadside.  \n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - Large pavement marking \u201cONLY\u201d is visible in the leftmost lane, confirming that lane is dedicated to exiting (i.e., taking the left fork).  \n   - The next lane to the right also appears to feed into the same exit, consistent with the two left arrows on the overhead sign.  \n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The overhead sign once again shows two leftward arrows for 183 (confirming the fork is served by two lanes).  \n   - Traffic in the leftmost two lanes is positioning to continue onto 183.  \n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - Final approach to the fork, showing that indeed those same two left lanes diverge left for 183, and the right lanes continue straight on 290.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nFrom the signs and lane markings across all frames, it is clear that two lanes (the far\u2010left lane plus the next lane over) are dedicated to or permitted to take the left fork toward 183 North. The \u201conly\u201d marking in the leftmost lane indicates that it must exit; the second lane from the left also merges onto the same exit ramp.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (1 lane) is contradicted by the sign\u2019s dual left arrows.  \n\u2022 B (2 lanes) aligns with both the overhead sign (two left arrows) and the lane markings (\u201cONLY\u201d on the left lane plus the adjacent lane also curving left).  \n\u2022 C (3 lanes) and D (4 lanes) are not supported by the signage or by standard lane configurations visible in the video.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>2</answer>",
