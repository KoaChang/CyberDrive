  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The driver is at the bottom of a rise; the signal lights in the distance are clearly green. No cross\u2010traffic is visible, and there is no immediate sign the signal is about to change (e.g., no flashing pedestrian countdown or amber light).  \n2. **Frame 2:** The car has moved a bit closer, and the same two primary green signals remain unchanged. Still no cross\u2010traffic or turning arrow signaling a split change.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The green lights look stable; no shift to yellow lights is visible. The roadway is lightly traveled at this hour, suggesting the controller may grant a longer green for this main corridor at night.  \n4. **Frame 4:** Again, the signals are still green with no indication that they will shortly turn yellow (e.g., no opposing traffic triggering a signal change).  \n5. **Frame 5:** The vehicle is closer but the signal remains solid green. No new information suggests an impending phase change.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nIn five consecutive seconds (represented by the five frames) there is no apparent sign that the light is nearing its end of green. Many urban signals, especially on main roads at night, remain green for longer stretches, often on the order of 20\u201330 seconds or more. A five\u2010second observation with no visible transition generally argues against the green being nearly finished.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A (5 seconds remaining)**: Unlikely, because five full seconds have passed in the video already with no indication of an imminent change.  \n- **B (15 seconds remaining)**: Possible, but typical major\u2010street greens\u2014especially off\u2010peak\u2014often exceed 15 seconds.  \n- **C (25 seconds remaining)**: Consistent with typical traffic\u2010signal cycle lengths on a main thoroughfare at night; no evidence the green phase is stale.  \n- **D (35 seconds remaining)**: While long greens do occur, 35 seconds would be less typical unless it were a heavily prioritized corridor. Twenty\u2010plus seconds is likelier than an extra half\u2010minute.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>25</answer>",
