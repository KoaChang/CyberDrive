Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f1:  \n  \u2013 Large orange \u201cDetour Ahead\u201d signs appear on the right; there is also a barricade straight ahead blocking the lane, with an orange arrow sign pointing left (labeled \u201cDetour Road\u201d).  \n  \u2013 A \u201cStop\u201d sign is on the right corner.  \n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f2:  \n  \u2013 The view is clearer that the road straight ahead is fully closed by orange barriers.  \n  \u2013 The same orange arrow sign on the barricade points left, indicating a detour.  \n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f3:  \n  \u2013 The bike\u2010lane symbol is visible, but the lane itself is blocked just beyond it.  \n  \u2013 The \u201cDetour Road\u201d sign (arrow pointing left) is more prominent, reaffirming that through\u2010traffic is diverted left.  \n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f4:  \n  \u2013 The \u201cStop\u201d sign is more clearly visible on the right side, where the intersection meets a cross street.  \n  \u2013 A \u201cOne Way\u201d sign is also present, its arrow pointing to the left\u2014further evidence that any turn onto this cross street must be left.  \n\n\u2022 Frame\u202f5:  \n  \u2013 The barricades completely seal off the straight path.  \n  \u2013 The left\u2010pointing \u201cDetour\u202f\u2192 Road\u201d sign and \u201cOne Way [\u2190]\u201d confirm that the only available (and legal) path is left.  \n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:\n\nSince forward travel is blocked and there is a detour arrow pointing left, plus the cross street is apparently one\u2010way to the left (as indicated by the \u201cOne Way\u201d sign), ego must turn left at the intersection.  \n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:\n\n\u2022 A. Turn left.  \n  \u2013 Matches all the signage and the detour/one\u2010way requirements.\n\n\u2022 B. Go straight.  \n  \u2013 Not possible; the barricade blocks the road and signage clearly forbids going straight.\n\n\u2022 C. Turn right.  \n  \u2013 Not supported by the \u201cOne Way\u201d arrow pointing left and the detour that directs traffic left.\n\n\u2022 D. Reverse.  \n  \u2013 No indication that reversing is needed or required; the detour directs a left turn.\n\n4. Provide the Best Answer:\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
