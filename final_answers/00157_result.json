  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\u2022 Frame 1: At the overhead signal, there\u2019s a small sign stating \u201cLeft Turn Yield on Flashing Yellow Arrow.\u201d However, far more prominent in this frame is a large orange, diamond\u2010shaped sign on the right reading \u201cBe Prepared to Stop.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The orange \u201cBe Prepared to Stop\u201d sign fills the foreground, and you can see another similar sign just beyond it.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: Although the camera has moved forward, that same (or a second) \u201cBe Prepared to Stop\u201d sign remains visible on the right as you proceed.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: Yet again, an orange sign with \u201cBe Prepared to Stop\u201d is visible in the right\u2010hand lane\u2019s view.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: We see at least one, possibly two, more of these orange \u201cBe Prepared to Stop\u201d signs beyond the truck.\n\nContextual Reasoning:  \nWhile there is one overhead sign about yielding on a flashing arrow, the multiple, large, orange, diamond\u2010shaped signs repeating \u201cBe Prepared to Stop\u201d dominate. This is clearly the message repeated most frequently along the road, suggesting upcoming conditions (perhaps construction or merging) that require motorists to be ready to halt.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:  \n\u2022 A. Yield \u2013 Only appears in a single smaller sign regarding the flashing yellow arrow.  \n\u2022 B. Stop \u2013 The signs do not read \u201cStop\u201d outright; they instruct preparedness.  \n\u2022 C. No right turn on red \u2013 No sign states this.  \n\u2022 D. Be prepared to stop \u2013 Matches exactly what is printed on the multiple large, orange signs.\n\n<answer>D. Be prepared to stop</answer>",
