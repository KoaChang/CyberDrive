  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1 & 2**:  \n   - The main (through\u2010traffic) lanes directly ahead are completely barricaded with barrels and a \u201cRoad Closed to Thru Traffic\u201d sign, indicating you cannot legally proceed straight.  \n   - Traffic signal is red for the through lane. There is a \u201cLEFT TURN YIELD ON GREEN\u201d sign above the signal, but at this moment its arrow is not yet green.  \n\n2. **Frame 3, 4 & 5**:  \n   - The left\u2010turn arrow has turned green while the through lanes remain blocked and the road\u2010closure signage is still in place.  \n   - A large detour sign is also present, directing traffic away from going straight.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the lane directly ahead is barricaded, \u201cgoing straight\u201d would be neither legal nor safe. The light turning green specifically for the left\u2010turn arrow\u2014along with the detour signage\u2014makes turning left the only valid maneuver. There is no indication in the frames of a permissive or open route to the right, and the through lane is obviously closed; thus, a left turn is the safe and legal option.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. \u201cStop\u201d alone is not an answer to how you should move through the intersection.  \nB. \u201cTurn Right\u201d is not signposted as the detour, and there is no clear open right\u2010turn lane or signage encouraging it.  \nC. \u201cProceed Straight\u201d is impossible given the barrels and \u201cRoad Closed\u201d sign.  \nD. \u201cTurn Left\u201d is explicitly enabled by the green arrow, aligns with the posted \u201cDetour,\u201d and is legal and safe.  \n\n<answer>D</answer>",
