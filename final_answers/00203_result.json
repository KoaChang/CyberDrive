  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1 & Frame 2:** The road slopes gently downward. No cones are yet visible in the travel lanes, though autumn foliage and a slight crest obscure parts of the road ahead.  \n2. **Frame 3:** Glare makes details hazy, but still no obvious lane obstructions.  \n3. **Frame 4:** Cones become visible on the far right, near a white retaining wall. They appear to be off the main travel lanes, stationed along the shoulder. The double\u2010yellow centerlines remain unobstructed.  \n4. **Frame 5:** The cones are clearly on the right shoulder, again near (but not intruding into) the main roadway. A vehicle ahead is continuing straight without having to maneuver around cones in its lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the cones are set off to the right shoulder, they do not extend into the lane the ego vehicle would be using to go straight. There is no separate right\u2010turn lane shown that the cones are blocking, nor are they arranged across the left side or center of the roadway. Hence, they do not interfere with the ego\u2019s forward path or require the ego to shift left or right in any unusual way.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Block ego\u2019s path forward?** Incorrect. The forward travel lane is open.  \n\u2022 **B. Block ego\u2019s path to the right?** Incorrect. The cones lie on the shoulder, not fully blocking any right\u2010turn path.  \n\u2022 **C. Block ego\u2019s path to the left?** Incorrect. All cones appear well to the right.  \n\u2022 **D. Do not block ego\u2019s path?** Correct. The cones sit off to the right shoulder and pose no blockage to either forward or turning movement.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
