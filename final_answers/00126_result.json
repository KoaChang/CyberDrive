  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The ego vehicle sits behind a black Scion in a lane with \u201cONLY\u201d painted on the pavement. To the left of the intersection, there appears to be a large grass median curving leftward. A \u201cturn\u2010only\u201d sign (left or U\u2010turn) is visible ahead, roughly aligned with the ego's lane.  \n2. **Frame 2**: The view of the pavement marking\u2014\u201cONLY\u201d\u2014is still prominent, and the signage in front (which suggests left/U\u2010turn arrows) remains centered over this lane.  \n3. **Frame 3**: The lane\u2019s marking does not change; it consistently indicates a dedicated movement (likely \u201cleft turn only\u201d or \u201cU\u2010turn only\u201d). None of the frames shows a straight\u2010through arrow in this lane.  \n4. **Frame 4**: As traffic advances slightly, it becomes even clearer the signage for this lane denotes a left/U\u2010turn movement. The adjacent lane to the right is proceeding straight ahead.  \n5. **Frame 5**: The \u201cONLY\u201d marking is clearly visible in front of the Scion. The lane is bounded by solid lane lines to the right, separating it from the through\u2010lane, and there is no indication that the ego\u2019s lane allows going straight.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll frames consistently show \u201cONLY\u201d on the pavement and a sign with left or U\u2010turn arrows overhead in the ego vehicle\u2019s lane. There is no evidence (such as a straight arrow or combined straight\u2010and\u2010left arrow) indicating that continuing straight is permitted from this lane. Parallel traffic in the next lane has a clear path going straight, further suggesting the ego\u2019s lane is dedicated to turning left (or possibly a U\u2010turn) only.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Yes.** This does not match the roadway markings, which show a dedicated turn lane.  \n\u2022 **B. No.** This fits the repeated \u201cONLY\u201d pavement marking and the overhead sign limiting the lane to turning movements only.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
