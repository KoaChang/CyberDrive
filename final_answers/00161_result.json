  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The white pickup is angled partway through a turn, well out in the open pavement. It does not appear to be in (or even next to) a marked parking stall, nor is it stopped in a yielding posture (i.e., waiting for our car).  \n2. **Frame 2:** The truck continues to pivot, with its nose swinging around to face more toward the camera\u2019s left. It is still not edging into a parking space.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The truck\u2019s angle has changed further, with the rear swinging around. There is no sign the driver is aligning with a curb or marked spot to park; instead, it moves incrementally so it can face the opposite direction.  \n4. **Frame 4:** It\u2019s now fairly clear the driver is maneuvering in a tight space\u2014rather than simply pulling alongside an edge or waiting for traffic, the truck is repositioning so it can travel in the new orientation.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The pickup has completed enough of its turning maneuver that it can drive forward in a new heading\u2014there is no indication of it stopping to park on the right or left, nor is it simply stopped yielding to the camera car.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nCollectively, the frames show a multi\u2010step turning maneuver, often called a three\u2010point (or multi\u2010point) turn, rather than any sign of dancing, parking, or yielding. The truck\u2019s incremental forward\u2010and\u2010back pivoting motion, especially visible in Frames 1\u20134, demonstrates it is turning around in the open area.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A. Dancing:** Not supported by any driving action.  \n- **B. Doing a 3\u2010point turn:** Best matches the observed turning maneuvers.  \n- **C. Parking:** There is no clear attempt to line up with any parking space.  \n- **D. Yielding to the ego:** The truck does not appear to be waiting for our dashcam vehicle to pass.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
