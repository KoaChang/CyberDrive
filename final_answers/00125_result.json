  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The dashcam (ego) is traveling in what appears to be the leftmost of two through\u2010lanes. A black SUV is clearly in the lane to the right. There is no additional paved lane visible beyond that SUV; to the right is a grassy shoulder and a sidewalk.\n\n\u2022 Frame 2: The same two lanes continue. Again, the black SUV remains in the right lane, and there is no separate turn lane or third lane on the right edge.\n\n\u2022 Frame 3: The view is similar: still only one lane directly to the right, with no sign of further lanes.\n\n\u2022 Frame 4: We see continuous roadway with a single right lane occupied by the SUV. No merging or additional right\u2010side lanes appear.\n\n\u2022 Frame 5: The two lanes for the ego\u2019s direction remain consistent; there is a median or landscaping strip on the left, and only one lane on the right.\n\nContextual Reasoning:\nAll five frames confirm there are only two lanes going in our direction\u2014the one we\u2019re in (left lane) and one to its immediate right. The area beyond the right lane is not a drivable lane but rather a shoulder/grass/sidewalk area.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\nA: 5 lanes to the right \u2013 clearly not supported by the frames.  \nB: 4 lanes to the right \u2013 no visual evidence of additional lanes beyond one.  \nC: 3 lanes to the right \u2013 again, not seen; we only observe one.  \nD: 2 lanes to the right \u2013 also incorrect, as there is only space for a single lane on the right.  \nE: 1 lane to the right \u2013 matches what we see in every frame.\n\n<answer>E</answer>",
