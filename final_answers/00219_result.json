  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: Ego is behind a maroon Chevy and a silver sedan, with a parallel lane of traffic to the right. Notably, there is a *solid* white line separating ego\u2019s lane from the lane on the right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The road geometry is the same; the right lane continues, and the same solid white boundary line still separates ego\u2019s lane from the right lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Traffic remains heavy in both lanes. The white line between ego\u2019s lane and the right lane appears unbroken (solid), suggesting that vehicles should not be crossing it.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The same solid white line continues. The right lane is also quite congested (so definitely not \u201cempty\u201d).  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: Ego is still behind the same vehicles; the striped/solid boundary to the right remains. No sign of it turning dashed or broken.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nA solid white line typically indicates that lane changes are discouraged or not permitted. Here, it does not appear to become a dashed line in any of the frames, so crossing it would be illegal or at least improper. There *is* a right lane, and we can see it is occupied by several vehicles, so it is not \u201cempty.\u201d There is also no obvious sign that ego is necessarily moving too fast\u2014the footage shows slow-moving traffic.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **(A) \u201cYes, because the right lane is empty.\u201d** This is incorrect. The right lane exists, but it is not empty.  \n- **(B) \u201cNo, because there is no right lane.\u201d** Incorrect, as there clearly *is* a right lane.  \n- **(C) \u201cNo, because of the solid white lines in between.\u201d** This matches what we see; the solid white line indicates a prohibited or highly discouraged lane change.  \n- **(D) \u201cNo, because ego is moving too fast.\u201d** We have no evidence from the frames of excessive speed.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
