  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1 & Frame 2**: The dashcam faces a wet, empty intersection at night, with red lights visible on both the left and right signals. No vehicles are present in the intersection.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: A silver minivan/SUV is clearly crossing the intersection, traveling laterally in front of the ego vehicle\u2014from the left side of the frame to the right side.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4 & Frame 5**: Intersection appears empty again (no vehicles crossing).  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom the dashcam\u2019s forward-facing perspective, the only observed moving car appears in Frame 3 and crosses perpendicular to the ego lane. It goes from the left portion of the image to the right portion.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) Same direction as ego \u2013 Not supported; the car is crossing perpendicular to the ego.  \n\u2022 (B) Opposite direction from ego \u2013 Also not supported; the car is not coming toward the dashcam, but is going laterally.  \n\u2022 (C) Left to right \u2013 Matches what is seen in Frame 3.  \n\u2022 (D) Right to left \u2013 Contradicts the observed motion in Frame 3.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>  ",
