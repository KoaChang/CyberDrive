  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** The black Chevy (far right) appears fully in its parking spot. No illumination (e.g., reverse lights or brake lights) is visible.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The car\u2019s position is unchanged relative to the parking stall lines; no signs of movement.  \n3. **Frame 3:** Still parked; no forward or backward shift by comparison to the parking lines.  \n4. **Frame 4:** Same vertical and horizontal alignment in the space; no indication of rolling or active backing up.  \n5. **Frame 5:** Continues to occupy exactly the same location. No brake or reverse lights, and the wheels have not changed orientation.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the vehicle does not show any visible lights or movement across all five seconds (and there are no other indicators suggesting it is temporarily held in gear with foot on the brake), the most likely explanation is that the car is in a stationary state with its transmission set to park.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **Reverse:** Typically accompanied by reverse lights or perceptible backward movement if that gear were actively engaged. Neither is seen.  \n- **Drive:** Would likely show partial forward movement or brake-light activation if the driver were holding the pedal. None observed.  \n- **Neutral:** Feasible but unusual to remain fully stationary on a level lot for a prolonged time without any sign of movement or brake lights; park is more likely in a long-term parking scenario.  \n- **Park:** Consistent with a car that remains motionless in a parking space, with no lights indicating gear engagement or pressure on the brake pedal.\n\n<answer>D. Park</answer>",
