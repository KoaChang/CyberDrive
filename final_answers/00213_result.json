  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** Even at a distance, you can see that the roadway fans out quite wide approaching the intersection. On the far right, there appear to be markings for at least one right\u2010turn\u2010only lane, and to the left of that is another lane with a large \u201cONLY\u201d marking partly visible.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** The \u201cONLY\u201d markings and their associated curved arrows are clearer. You can now distinctly see two adjacent lanes on the right, both labeled \u201cONLY\u201d with right\u2010turn arrows.\n\n3. **Frame 3:** The two right\u2010turn\u2010only lanes are fully confirmed by their pavement arrows; meanwhile, there are multiple lanes continuing straight in the center/left. Overhead signals show two left\u2010arrow indications on the far left, two straight\u2010arrow signals in the middle, and one right\u2010arrow signal on the far right (often covering both right\u2010turn lanes).\n\n4. **Frame 4:** The two right\u2010turn\u2010only lanes remain plainly visible, and the left side of the roadway (where the black SUV is traveling) has two left\u2010turn lanes (indicated by the two red left arrows on the signal). Two through lanes occupy the middle.\n\n5. **Frame 5:** Final close\u2010up before the stop bar shows the same layout: two left\u2010turn lanes on the far left, two through lanes in the middle, and two right\u2010turn\u2010only lanes on the right.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nCollectively, the pavement markings and overhead signals point to:\n- **Two dedicated left\u2010turn lanes** on the far left (the left\u2010arrow signals).  \n- **Two through lanes** in the center (the straight\u2010arrow signals).  \n- **Two right\u2010turn\u2010only lanes** on the far right (the large \u201cONLY\u201d markings with right\u2010turn arrows).  \n\nThat totals **six lanes** in the ego (our) direction.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (5 lanes) \u2010 contradicted by the two right\u2010turn\u2010only lanes plus at least two left\u2010turn lanes and two through lanes.  \n\u2022 B (6 lanes) \u2010 matches the clear layout of 2 left\u2010turn + 2 through + 2 right\u2010turn lanes.  \n\u2022 C (7 lanes) and D (8 lanes) \u2010 the markings do not support that many lanes.\n\n**Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
