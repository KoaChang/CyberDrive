  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1** shows a diamond\u2010shaped warning sign on the left reading \u201cLEFT LANE ENDS.\u201d You can clearly see a solid yellow line along the far left road edge and a dashed white line just to the right of the ego lane\u2014indicating there is a distinct leftmost lane that is about to disappear.  \n2. **Frames 2 and 3** still show multiple lanes ahead, with that same \u201cLEFT LANE ENDS\u201d sign on the left. Ego appears to be straddling or near the leftmost through\u2010lane (the one that the sign indicates will end).  \n3. **Frames 4 and 5** confirm that the leftmost lane tapers out (the dashed lines converge), forcing its traffic to merge right. Meanwhile, the farther right lanes remain intact, including a \u201cRIGHT TURN ONLY\u201d lane on the far right (as seen by \u201cONLY\u201d pavement markings).\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 Because of the \u201cLEFT LANE ENDS\u201d sign and the visibly tapering leftmost lane, traffic there must merge into the adjacent (center) lane.  \n\u2022 The ego vehicle\u2019s camera view and lane alignment suggest that it is indeed in that leftmost lane, which is gradually disappearing, requiring a merge to the lane on the immediate right.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. \u201cEgo is on the left most lane merging to the lane on the right.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This matches what we see: a posted \u201cLEFT LANE ENDS\u201d sign and the ego positioned in that left lane, which must move right.  \n  \nB. \u201cEgo is on the right most lane merging to the lane on the left.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Not supported by the frames; the right\u2010most lane is a turn lane and there is no sign indicating the right lane is ending or merging.  \n  \nC. \u201cEgo is in the center lane merging to the lane on the left.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Contradicted by the \u201cLEFT LANE ENDS\u201d sign and the fact it is the left lane that merges right, not vice versa.  \n  \nD. \u201cEgo is in the center lane merging to the lane on the right.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Again, the sign and markings show the left lane ending, not the center lane.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>",
