  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1** \u2013 Three lanes are visible: a left lane (with a pronounced left\u2010turn arrow), a center lane in which our camera car is stopped, and a right lane where the pickup truck is. The markings for the camera car\u2019s lane appear to show a combination straight\u2013and\u2013left arrow; there is no right\u2010turn arrow visible in the center lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2** \u2013 The same three\u2010lane arrangement is clearer. The rightmost lane (with the pickup truck) is the only lane whose markings appear to permit a right turn (though it may also allow through traffic).  \n\u2022 **Frames 3\u20135** \u2013 The center lane\u2019s pavement markings consistently suggest straight or left possibilities, but not right. Meanwhile, the pickup truck\u2019s lane on the far right is the sole lane positioned for turning right at the corner.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nNo additional lanes open up to the right beyond the pickup truck; the center lane does not show any right\u2010turn arrows in any of the frames. Standard intersection design would likewise place right turns in that far\u2010right lane only.  \n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**  \n(A single right\u2010turn lane), (two right\u2010turn lanes), (three), or (four): the markings confirm just one lane from which a right turn is permitted.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A. 1</answer>",
