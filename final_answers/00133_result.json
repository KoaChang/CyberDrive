  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** We are traveling on a multilane highway behind a tanker truck and next to a red SUV; a silver sedan is ahead in the right lane. Overpasses and ramp signage are visible, but the traffic light in the distance is not yet clearly identifiable.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The same vehicles remain in roughly the same relative positions. A single traffic signal on the right side (beneath the overpass) becomes more apparent.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The signal is clearly green and appears to control a ramp or side lane, not the main highway lanes. The tanker truck, SUV, and sedan continue straight on the main highway.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The ramp signal remains on the right. No overhead signals or lane markings indicate that the main highway lanes are controlled by this light.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The signal is still green. The main traffic flow (including the ego vehicle) proceeds without any indication the signal applies to its lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause this single traffic light sits off to the right on a separate ramp and there are no overhead signals controlling the through lanes, it is almost certainly a ramp\u2010meter or side\u2010lane signal rather than one for the main highway. Traffic on the highway (the ego lane) proceeds unimpeded, and there are no indications (e.g., road markings or signage) that the ego vehicle would need to stop if that signal turned red.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A (Yes)** would apply if the light controlled the lane we are in, but there is no evidence here that it does.  \n- **B (No)** fits the situation where the signal does not govern our lane.  \n- **C (Ambiguous)** might apply if it were unclear whether the light controlled the main lanes, but the frames strongly suggest it controls only the ramp or side lane.  \n- **D (There are no traffic lights in the scene)** is incorrect; there is a visible traffic signal.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>",
