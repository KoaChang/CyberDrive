  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1** \u2013 Two red left\u2010turn arrows are clearly visible on the signal pole in the center of the intersection (one mounted above the other). There do not appear to be any other red arrow signals in view; the other red signals are circular or too far in the background to be left arrows.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2** \u2013 Same two red left\u2010turn arrows remain in view; again, no additional arrows are apparent.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3** \u2013 The two red arrows for the left turn lane are still brightly lit. No new red arrows are visible elsewhere.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4** \u2013 The same pair of red left\u2010turn arrows is present, and there are no extra arrows lighting up.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5** \u2013 Exactly the same two red left\u2010turn signals persist.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all five frames, only these two red left\u2010turn arrows are ever observed. No third arrow\u2014or additional red arrow\u2014comes into view, despite the presence of other red lights (which appear to be solid red signals for different lanes or farther intersections).  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A. 0 \u2013 Not possible, as two clearly lit red left\u2010turn arrows are seen.  \n\u2022 B. 1 \u2013 Incorrect; there are consistently two red left\u2010turn arrows.  \n\u2022 C. 2 \u2013 Matches our observation (two distinct red left\u2010turn arrows remain lit throughout).  \n\u2022 D. 3 \u2013 No evidence of a third red arrow in any frame.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
