  "answer": "<analysis>\nBased on the roadway markings visible in the later frames (especially frames\u202f4 and\u202f5), the white Volvo ahead is straddling a lane whose painted arrow clearly has both a \u201cstraight\u201d component and a \u201cleft\u2010turn\u201d branch. Although there is a \u201cno U\u2010turn\u201d sign (the large circular sign with a hooked arrow crossed out), there is no sign or marking prohibiting left turns from this middle lane. In the final two frames, you can see multiple arrows on the pavement: the leftmost lane has a dedicated left\u2010turn arrow; the lane the ego (and the white Volvo) occupy has that split arrow indicating left\u2010turn\u2010or\u2010straight; and lanes further right continue straight or right. Hence the correct answer is that this lane allows both going straight and making a left turn.\n</analysis>\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
