  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** The camera looks down a residential street. A large red stop sign is visible at the right corner. \u201cSTOP\u201d is also painted on the roadway, though from this angle the lower \u201cALL WAY\u201d plaque is not yet in clear view.  \n2. **Frame 2:** Slightly closer; the same stop sign on the right and the roadway \u201cSTOP\u201d marking become more prominent. No overhead traffic signals, no indications of a roundabout.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The pavement \u201cSTOP\u201d marking is now very large in the foreground, still only the top portion of the sign is clear.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The red stop sign is fully visible, with \u201cALL WAY\u201d displayed beneath \u201cSTOP.\u201d There is no traffic signal above and no roundabout island.  \n5. **Frame 5:** From this final approach, the sign clearly reads \u201cSTOP\u201d at the top and \u201cALL WAY\u201d at the bottom. There are no lights or yield signs typical of a roundabout or a two\u2010way stop.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nGiven the repeated \u201cSTOP\u201d markings on the pavement in multiple directions (visible on side streets as well) and an \u201cALL WAY\u201d plaque on the sign, this indicates that all directions must stop at the intersection\u2014i.e., an all\u2010way stop. There is no evidence of traffic lights (eliminating option A), no circular traffic island (eliminating B), and the sign specifically says \u201cALL WAY,\u201d contradicting the idea that cross traffic does not stop (eliminating C).\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. Traffic light intersection \u2192 No traffic lights observed.  \nB. Roundabout \u2192 No roundabout island or yield signs.  \nC. Cross traffic does not stop \u2192 The \u201cALL WAY\u201d sign shows that cross traffic does stop.  \nD. All way stop \u2192 Consistent with the signage and markings.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
