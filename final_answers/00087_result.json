  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n- **Frame 1:** Looking to the right, there is a line of dark\u2010colored sedans/SUVs and at least one white sedan. They appear stationary by the curb (rather than in a moving lane). About five or six distinct cars are visible in this initial shot.  \n- **Frame 2:** The camera has advanced; we see the same row more clearly. Counting from front to back: a black sedan, a second black/dark\u2010gray sedan, a dark\u2010blue Tesla, another black sedan, a white sedan, and then at least one more dark sedan behind it. So there are at least six there.  \n- **Frame 3:** The same group is still visible, and it appears they have not moved. We again see roughly six individual cars lined up on the right.  \n- **Frames 4\u20135:** By these frames, those cars are no longer alongside the ego vehicle, indicating the ego has passed them.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll of those vehicles on the right appear parked/standing rather than simply stopped in traffic. By Frame 4, the ego is well clear of them, confirming that the ego vehicle has indeed passed that line of six or so cars by the curb.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- Fewer than six (e.g., 2) is too low based on visual counting.  \n- More than six (like 10) does not match the clearly visible number of cars; there are no signs of four additional cars beyond the six or so clearly in view.  \n- \u201cNone\u201d conflicts with the obvious row of stationary vehicles.  \n- \u201c6\u201d is the only count that matches the observed row.\n\n<answer>B. 6.</answer>",
