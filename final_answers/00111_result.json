  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   \u2013 The large overhead signal above center\u2010lane is red.  \n   \u2013 On the right\u2010side pole (near the \u201c37th Ave\u201d sign), there is another red signal for the same approach.  \n   \u2013 There is also a pedestrian \u201chand\u201d signal illuminated on that right\u2010side pole, but we are told to ignore pedestrian lights.\n\n2. **Frame 2 through Frame 5**  \n   \u2013 These subsequent frames show the same two red signals controlling the main approach (the large overhead and the right\u2010side pole).  \n   \u2013 The pedestrian signal remains lit (ignored per instructions).  \n   \u2013 No additional signal heads appear for the driver\u2019s lane (for example, there is no separate left\u2010turn arrow signal visible).  \n   \u2013 Farther down the road, there are other signals for upcoming intersections, but those are not controlling the current intersection.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nOnly the overhead red signal and the red signal on the right\u2010side pole directly govern the driver\u2019s through movement at this intersection. Although there is a nearby pedestrian signal, it does not factor into the count per the instruction to ignore pedestrian lights.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (1) is incorrect because there is more than one visible traffic signal head controlling the approach.  \n\u2022 B (2) matches what we see: one overhead plus one on the right\u2010side pole.  \n\u2022 C (4) and D (5) are too high for the current intersection, as no other signal heads for this approach are evident beyond the two red lights.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",
