  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**: Five lanes are visible. Overhead signs show two upcoming exits: one for \u201cHarrison\u202fSt / Embarcadero\u201d and one for \u201cFremont\u202fSt / Folsom\u202fSt.\u201d At this distance, it is not entirely clear which lanes go where, but there is a yellow \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d plaque under the Fremont/Folsom sign, suggesting at least one dedicated exit lane to the right.\n\n2. **Frame 2**: Similar signage is more in\u2010focus. The \u201cFremont\u202fSt / Folsom\u202fSt\u202fExit\u202f2C\u201d sign is still accompanied by an \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d marking, aligned above (or nearly above) the far\u2010right lane.\n\n3. **Frame 3**: The overhead gantry shows distinct green signs over the roadway. The \u201cHarrison\u202fSt / Embarcadero\u201d arrow appears to hover over the middle lanes, while \u201cFremont St / Folsom St Exit\u202f2C EXIT\u202fONLY\u201d is aligned with the right\u2010most side.\n\n4. **Frame 4**: Road arrows on the pavement start to come into view. The far\u2010right lane\u2019s sign/arrow is clearly labeled \u201cEXIT\u202fONLY.\u201d Adjacent lanes (to the left of the rightmost) show straight\u2010ahead arrows only.\n\n5. **Frame 5**: The critical shot. Painted lane arrows confirm that the far\u2010right lane (under the \u201cEXIT\u202fONLY\u201d sign) diverges off to the exit. The next lane left still has only a straight arrow, meaning it continues on the freeway rather than exiting. There is no sign or dashed lane marking indicating that the second\u2010right lane can exit.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nCombining signage (\u201cEXIT\u202fONLY\u201d for Fremont/Folsom) with the final frame\u2019s lane arrows, only the far\u2010right lane is required (and able) to take that exit. The lane immediately left of it goes straight and does not appear to offer an exit option.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A. \u201cOnly rightmost\u201d \u2013 Consistent with the \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d sign over that lane.  \n\u2022 B. \u201cRight two lanes\u201d \u2013 Would require a second lane also merging right or showing a split arrow, which it does not.  \n\u2022 C. \u201cRight three lanes\u201d \u2013 No indication that three lanes can exit; signage refutes this.  \n\u2022 D. \u201cLeftmost lane\u201d \u2013 Contradicts both signs and markings.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
