  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The camera view is on a multi\u2010lane highway at night. There is a silver sedan ahead in the left lane, while the \u201cLane Ends, Merge Left\u201d sign, visible on the right, suggests a lane reduction is upcoming. No obvious hazards or pedestrians appear in this frame.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** The situation remains steady: same sedan ahead, traffic is flowing normally, still no sign of immediate braking or pedestrians.\n\n3. **Frame 3:** We see a \u201cmerge\u201d warning sign in front of the sedan. Traffic ahead looks normal; again, no indication of any sudden moves or harsh braking from the vehicle in front.\n\n4. **Frame 4:** The next sign, with two vertical arrows converging, confirms a lane merge. Still, the leading car does not appear to be braking harshly. However, boxes or objects begin to appear in the distance on the roadway.\n\n5. **Frame 5:** Several large pieces of debris are clearly scattered across the lane. These pieces are sizable enough that simply rolling over them would likely be risky. There is no pedestrian visible, and the car ahead is not stopping nor braking harshly\u2014yet the lane is partially obstructed by the debris.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\n\u2022 There is no pedestrian (so no reason to swerve for a person).  \n\u2022 The car ahead is not braking harshly (so no need to stop for a sudden deceleration).  \n\u2022 From the final frame, the roadway is littered with bulky objects that would demand avoidance rather than driving directly over them if possible.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\nA.\u202fSwerve for a pedestrian.  \n\u2794 No pedestrians present.  \n\nB.\u202fStop for a harsh braking car in the front.  \n\u2794 The leading vehicle is moving normally; no harsh braking evident.  \n\nC.\u202fSwerve to avoid road debris.  \n\u2794 The debris is large enough to warrant steering around it rather than simply continuing straight or stopping.  \n\nD.\u202fSlow down to drive over road debris.  \n\u2794 Given how large the objects appear, and that lanes are open enough to maneuver, swerving makes more sense than rolling over them.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
