  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 Roadway appears to split ahead under multiple overpasses. The only easily readable sign so far is a green highway guide sign in the distance. Hard to discern lane\u2010specific arrows yet, but we can see there are at least three lanes.\n\n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 The green guide sign becomes a bit clearer, showing separate arrows for different destinations. It looks like the left lanes are going toward Cesar Chavez / 5th\u20137th Streets (the arrows lean left), and there is a separate right or center/right arrow (hard to see precisely here) for \u201cAirport Blvd.\u201d\n\n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 The sign\u2019s lane arrows come more into view. There appear to be two left arrows for \u201cCesar Chavez St\u201d and \u201c5th\u20137th Sts,\u201d and one straight (or rightmost) arrow labeled \u201cAirport Blvd.\u201d The roadway itself still has roughly three lanes.\n\n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 The large overhead sign now clearly shows two left arrows (for Cesar Chavez and 5th\u20137th) and one arrow that goes straight (to the right side) for \u201cAirport Blvd.\u201d Lane markings confirm that the rightmost lane continues straight while the left two curve leftward.\n\n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 The final, close\u2010up view of the overhead sign and the lane lines confirms that the leftmost two lanes are marked to exit or veer left to Cesar Chavez/5th\u20137th, while the rightmost lane proceeds forward (straight) to \u201cAirport Blvd.\u201d\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nFrom frames 3\u20135, the sign layout shows that traffic for Airport Blvd must stay to the right. Both left lanes are dedicated to other exits (Cesar Chavez and 5th\u20137th). There is no indication that the center lane will also reach Airport Blvd; rather, it too peels off to the left.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (Left lane only) and B (Left and center) can be eliminated, as both left lanes go downtown.  \n\u2022 C (Right lane only) matches our observations that the single rightside lane leads to \u201cAirport Blvd.\u201d  \n\u2022 D (Right lane and center) is not correct because the center lane also goes left, not to the Airport.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
