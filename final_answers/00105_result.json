  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010frame analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1:  \n  \u2013 Right side: A large RV is clearly visible up ahead. Behind it (closer to the camera), there appears to be a yellow sedan, then a dark SUV. At the very right edge (roughly near the corner), there is a bulky truck\u2010type vehicle with a bed or container in the rear (not yet clearly visible).  \n  \u2013 No bicycle is apparent.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 2:  \n  \u2013 The RV is still farther up the block on the right. The yellow car and dark SUV remain between the RV and the camera. That same tall\u2010sided truck toward the near right edge is becoming a bit clearer, though still obscured by darkness and weather.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 3:  \n  \u2013 RV remains ahead on the right. The yellow car and SUV are still behind it (i.e., closer to the camera than the RV). The truck\u2019s shape is more discernible, showing a large, squared\u2010off cargo area.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 4:  \n  \u2013 The camera has progressed; the RV is now noticeably farther away compared to that truck on the right edge, which is quite close in the foreground. Still no bicycle or minivan visible on the right side.  \n\n\u2022 Frame 5:  \n  \u2013 Closest to the camera on the right side is what looks like a short\u2010bed or dump\u2010style cargo truck (large open container on back)\u2014consistent with a \u201cconstruction truck.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The RV is farther up the block. The yellow car and SUV are also ahead of the truck from the camera\u2019s perspective.  \n  \u2013 No bicycle is visible, and a minivan only appears on the left side of the street.  \n\nContextual reasoning and matching to choices:  \n\u2022 The largest, boxy, open\u2010bed vehicle nearest the camera on the right cannot be an RV or a minivan.  \n\u2022 No bicycle is present on the right side of the roadway.  \n\u2022 By appearance and proximity, the bulky open\u2010bed vehicle is best identified as the \u201cconstruction truck.\u201d  \n\nTherefore, the vehicle on the right side of the road that is closest to ego is the construction truck.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
