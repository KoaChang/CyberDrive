  "answer": "1. FRAME\u2010BY\u2010FRAME ANALYSIS  \n\u2022 Frame 1: The signal for the driver\u2019s direction is red. A \u201cONE WAY\u201d sign with a left\u2010pointing arrow is clearly visible on the right\u2010side pole (near the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts). This indicates the cross street runs from right to left.  \n\u2022 Frames 2 & 3: The same one\u2010way sign and red traffic light remain in view; no additional signage permitting a right turn appears.  \n\u2022 Frames 4 & 5: No changes to the intersection\u2019s layout or signage; the right side of the intersection (where one might turn) is essentially the wrong\u2010way entry to a one\u2010way street.  \n\n2. CONTEXTUAL REASONING  \nBecause the cross street is posted \u201cONE WAY\u201d to the left, turning right into that street would mean driving upstream against traffic. There is no sign granting an exception (like a dedicated right\u2010turn arrow or \u201cRight on Red\u201d permission), nor does anything in the frames suggest a separate roadway on that side where a legal right turn might be made.  \n\n3. MATCH TO ANSWER CHOICES  \n\u2022 A (Yes) is ruled out, as there is nothing permitting a right turn and the one\u2010way arrangement forbids it.  \n\u2022 B (No) aligns with the signage and standard rules: a right turn here would violate the one\u2010way.  \n\u2022 C (Ambiguous) and D (None of the above) do not fit, since the signage is quite explicit.  \n\n4.
