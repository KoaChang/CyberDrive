  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The roadway is fairly clear; the cyclist is straight ahead. No obvious runner in shorts is visible near center frame.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2 & Frame 3:** Still no clear sign of the running pedestrian; the cyclist is nearer the center of the roadway.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** A runner (t\u2010shirt and shorts) appears to the right of the cyclist, entering the crosswalk area on the driver\u2019s right side of center.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The same runner is now nearer the middle/left portion of the crosswalk, clearly moving across the road toward the driver\u2019s left.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom Frame 4 to Frame 5, the pedestrian is running across the lanes from the right side of the driver\u2019s viewpoint to the left side. The cyclist continues forward, whereas the runner cuts across the road, indicating a right\u2010to\u2010left crossing relative to the dashcam (ego) perspective.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) & (B) \u2013 Not moving along the road in the same or opposite direction; the pedestrian is crossing, not running along the lane.  \n\u2022 (C) \u2013 \u201cLeft to right\u201d contradicts the frames, since the pedestrian starts on the driver\u2019s right and finishes on the left.  \n\u2022 (D) \u2013 \u201cFrom right to left\u201d accurately reflects the directional transition visible in Frames 4 and 5.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
