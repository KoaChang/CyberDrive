  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The black SUV is centered in its lane, with both tail lights lit (normal for night driving). There is no obvious extra illumination on either tail light that would suggest a turn signal.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** The SUV remains in the same lane, still just standard tail lights without any flashing or brighter/amber light on one side.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The vehicle is close to a green traffic light. Tail lights remain steady\u2014no evidence of a left or right indicator.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** Approaching the intersection, tail lights again appear symmetrical and unchanged, so no apparent blinking.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** A pickup truck passes on the left, but the SUV\u2019s tail lights appear the same\u2014still no flashing on either side.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all five frames, the SUV never shows a telltale alternating bright flash on one side (turn signal) nor an all\u2010around blink (hazard lights). The tail lamps remain steady red, consistent with regular night\u2010time driving lights (possibly brake lights briefly brightening but no repeated on/off to indicate a blinker).\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (No blinker is on): Matches the consistent, non\u2010flashing tail lights in all frames.  \n\u2022 B (Left blinker on): Would require a brighter/intermittent flash on the left side, which we do not see.  \n\u2022 C (Right blinker on): Same reasoning as for B; no flashing is visible on the right side.  \n\u2022 D (Hazard lights on): Would show simultaneous left\u2010right flashing, which is not evident.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A. No blinker is on.</answer>",
