  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n- **Frame 1:** The ego\u2010vehicle (camera car) is on an elevated ramp bounded by concrete walls on both sides. There is a solid yellow line on the left (centerline) and no dashed divider to the right, indicating that the ramp is a single, dedicated lane at this point.  \n- **Frame 2:** Conditions are essentially unchanged from Frame 1; still a single\u2010lane ramp with no adjacent same\u2010direction lane.  \n- **Frame 3:** The ramp continues with the same single\u2010lane configuration. Although one can see numerous lanes below on the main highway, none of them is yet contiguous with the ego\u2019s lane.  \n- **Frame 4:** The SUV ahead remains in the only lane on this ramp; concrete barriers still run on both sides, and there is no signage or marking indicating an additional operational lane traveling the same direction on this ramp.  \n- **Frame 5:** The ramp still has the same basic layout: a single lane with a barrier on the left and a barrier/guardrail on the right. Though the highway ahead has multiple lanes, the ego\u2010vehicle has not yet merged onto them.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross all five frames, the driver is confined to a single\u2010lane flyover/ramp, separated from the multi\u2010lane highway visible below. The question asks specifically for the number of _drivable lanes traveling in the ego\u2019s direction **on the ego\u2019s current road**_. In these frames, that \u201ccurrent road\u201d is the flyover/ramp itself, which never shows more than one operational lane in the ego\u2019s direction. Any other lanes down below belong to a different roadway or are separated by concrete barriers.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A. 1** \u2013 This matches the single\u2010lane ramp configuration seen in all frames.  \n- **B. 2, C. 3, D. 4** \u2013 These would require lane striping or clear adjacent lanes in the same direction, none of which appears on the ramp.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
