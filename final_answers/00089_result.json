  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1 and 2:** The camera is looking down what appears to be a side street at night. No stop signage is immediately visible in these first two frames, though the street is fairly narrow and seems secondary (versus a main thoroughfare).\n\n2. **Frame 3:** The intersection ahead begins to come into view. You can see cross\u2010traffic on a busier, well\u2010lit roadway; still no clear signposts on the far corners.\n\n3. **Frame 4:** A large, octagonal STOP sign is now clearly visible on the right\u2010hand corner, facing the dashcam\u2019s direction of travel. No corresponding stop sign is visible opposite it in this shot, nor are there stop signs on the cross street.\n\n4. **Frame 5:** Again, the same STOP sign for the dashcam\u2019s direction is plainly visible. There is no matching STOP sign across the intersection for oncoming traffic. Nor does the cross street appear to have stop signs; it has traffic signals farther down but no stop sign controlling the intersection itself.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\n\u2022 Because the only STOP sign visible is for the side street used by the dashcam (and presumably its opposing direction), while the cross street does not seem to have any stop signs, this suggests a two\u2010way stop condition applying to the dashcam\u2019s street.  \n\u2022 We do not see stop signs at all four corners (which would be a four\u2010way stop) and it is clear that at least one STOP sign is present (so it is not \u201cNo stop signs\u201d).  \n\u2022 It is also not a \u201ctwo\u2010way stop for cross traffic\u201d because the sign we do see is for the ego street, not for the main road.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (Two way stop for ego) fits the evidence: the dashcam street is controlled by STOP signs, while the cross street does not appear to stop.  \n\u2022 B (Two way stop for cross traffic) would require stop signs on the major road only, which we do not see.  \n\u2022 C (Four way stop) is incorrect because we observe only one (or possibly two facing each other) STOP signs for the side street.  \n\u2022 D (No stop signs present) is contradicted by the clearly visible STOP sign.  \n\n<answer>A</answer>",
