  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - The SUV ahead does not appear to have any lights illuminated. There is no bright glow in the taillight area or high\u2010mounted center brake light.  \n   - The road curves gently to the right; the SUV remains in its lane, and there is no obvious sign of turning or braking at this instant.\n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - Similar to Frame 1, the rear lights of the SUV do not appear to be lit. The SUV is still proceeding generally straight.\n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - Here the SUV\u2019s center (high\u2010mounted) brake light and corner brake lights look brightly illuminated. This is the first clear instance in which the SUV\u2019s rear lights are distinctly lit.\n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - The bright center brake light (and entire brake\u2010light strip) continues to be illuminated. No one\u2010sided turn signal indication is present; instead, it is the full brake\u2010light pattern.\n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - Again, the center and corner brake lights remain lit. The SUV is still positioned in the same lane, and there are no blinking lights on one side or both sides that would suggest a turn signal or hazard lights.\n\n---\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nFrom Frames 3 onward, the high\u2010mounted center brake light and the rest of the brake lights remain illuminated consistently. A turn signal would typically show only on one side (left or right); hazard lights would flash the same corner lights on both sides (and would not activate the center brake light). Since the bright center brake lamp is lit (and stays lit rather than blinking), this indicates the driver in front is pressing the brake pedal rather than signaling a turn or hazard.\n\n---\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **A. Left turn signal**  \n  Not supported: no single left\u2010side light is flashing or illuminated.\n\n- **B. Brake lights**  \n  Supported: the frames clearly show the center and rear brake lamps illuminated steadily beginning in Frame 3 (rather than a blinking pattern or one\u2010sided illumination).\n\n- **C. Right turn signal**  \n  Not supported: no single right\u2010side light is flashing or illuminated.\n\n- **D. Hazard lights**  \n  Not supported: hazard lights do not typically illuminate the center brake light, and they would blink on both corner turn indicators, which is not observed.\n\n---\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B. Brake lights</answer>",
