  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:  \n\u2022\u202fFrame\u202f1:  Ego is trailing a blue sedan.  There are cars parked along the right\u2010hand curb.  The center markings are double\u2010yellow lines; no separate turn lane or bollards are yet evident.  \n\u2022\u202fFrame\u202f2:  Still behind the same sedan; traffic continues both directions.  No obvious dedicated turn channel is visible yet, but the road widens slightly ahead.  \n\u2022\u202fFrame\u202f3:  The painted center lines appear to diverge.  We begin to see what could be a separate space in the middle of the roadway.  \n\u2022\u202fFrame\u202f4:  White plastic posts (\u201cbollards\u201d) come into view, separating a center lane from through traffic.  This barrier suggests a dedicated (physically protected) turn pocket.  \n\u2022\u202fFrame\u202f5:  The left\u2010turn arrow is painted on the pavement in that center pocket, and the bollards clearly isolate it from the travel lane.  \n\nContextual Reasoning:  \nThe frames show the approach to an intersection with a protected left\u2010turn lane delineated by bollards.  If ego remains in the current lane (behind the blue sedan), it will be forced to go straight or make a right access; the bollards block a late merge into the left\u2010turn pocket.  \n\nMatching to Answer Choices:  \n\u2022\u202fA (Stay in current lane) would not allow a left turn, as the bollards separate a dedicated left\u2010turn pocket to the left.  \n\u2022\u202fB (Lane change to the left, looking out for the traffic light) describes moving left but omits the obvious hazard of the physical bollards that must be negotiated before the turn lane fully begins.  \n\u2022\u202fC (Lane change to the left, looking out for the bollards) is the most accurate, because the frames show a row of bollards protecting the turn lane.  Ego needs to merge left before or at the start of that barrier.  \n\u2022\u202fD (Lane change to the right) is irrelevant for a left turn.  \n\nConclusion:  \nBecause the left\u2010turn pocket is physically separated by bollards, the correct move is to shift left into that pocket before the barrier.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
