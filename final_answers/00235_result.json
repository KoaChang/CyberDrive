  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1**  \n   - We are in a single through\u2010lane (with parallel parking on the right).  A bus is to our left, in what appears to be a separate (left or bus) lane.  \n   - Pavement markings directly ahead appear to say \u201cONLY,\u201d but the accompanying arrow is not fully clear here.  \n\n2. **Frame 2**  \n   - Still one general\u2010purpose lane in our direction, with no visible separate right\u2010turn lane.  Nothing here suggests that left turns are prohibited (no \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign) or that we must only go straight.  \n\n3. **Frame 3**  \n   - The intersection is coming into view; again, the roadway configuration is one basic through\u2010lane in our direction, plus a bus/left lane left of us.  \n\n4. **Frame 4**  \n   - A prominently posted \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d regulatory sign is visible near the traffic light on the nearer corner (a black right\u2010arrow with a red slash).  \n   - No \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d sign or pavement marking is seen that would forbid turning left from our lane.  \n\n5. **Frame 5**  \n   - The \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign is most clearly visible here.  Still no sign or marking disallowing left turns from our lane.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause we see a \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign applying to this intersection and there is no indication that left turns are prohibited, the only legal restrictions we can confirm visually are against turning right.  Commonly, if there is no posted restriction and only one through lane, left turns are allowed from that lane.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A. Go straight only.**  \n  \u2010 Not correct: nothing prohibits turning left.  \n- **B. Go straight and turn left.**  \n  \u2010 Best fits what we see: we can go straight and are not barred from left turns, but a right turn is explicitly disallowed.  \n- **C. Go straight and turn right.**  \n  \u2010 Conflicts with the \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign.  \n- **D. Go straight, turn left, and turn right.**  \n  \u2010 Also conflicts with the \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
