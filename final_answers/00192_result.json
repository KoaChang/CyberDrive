  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The camera faces uphill toward an intersection with overhead traffic signals. Two signal heads are visible, each showing essentially the same bright, warm\u2010toned (amber) light. A fire truck with red emergency lights is approaching from ahead. The signals\u2019 color clearly differs from the truck\u2019s red emergency lights, looking more orange\u2010amber.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** The signals still show that same warm color in both heads; no green or red lens is illuminated.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** Again, the two overhead signals appear lit with an amber hue, while the fire truck\u2019s red lights continue to stand out separately.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** The truck passes through the intersection. The overhead signals remain bright amber, consistent with a flashing caution light rather than solid red or green.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The traffic signals, still on, maintain that amber color. At no point do the signals switch to a green or red lens.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFlashing traffic lights often flash either yellow (to indicate proceed with caution) or red (to indicate a stop and proceed when safe). Here, the light\u2019s color is clearly in the amber/yellow range, visually distinct from the brilliant red of the fire truck lights. There is no evidence of a green or blue signal, nor does the color match either of those choices.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. Green \u2013 Not supported; the signal shows a warm amber color, not green.  \nB. Yellow \u2013 Matches the observed amber tone.  \nC. Red \u2013 Contradicted by the red fire truck lights, which are distinct from the signal\u2019s color.  \nD. Blue \u2013 Not standard for traffic signals and not seen here.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>  ",
