  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: Roadway is at night. There are multiple vehicles ahead. No clearly visible speed limit signage from this angle.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: Signage begins to come into view on the right but is still not fully readable.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: A sign on the right with black letters on a white background appears; it looks like a speed limit sign. The figure \u201c60\u201d seems likely but still somewhat small.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The sign is much clearer. Text reads \u201cSPEED LIMIT 60.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 5: Again the sign is visible and readable with \u201cSPEED LIMIT 60.\u201d\n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:  \n   Across frames 3 through 5, the posted speed limit sign on the right shoulder clearly reads \u201cSPEED LIMIT 60.\u201d There are no other lower or higher limit signs visible, and the roadway resembles a higher\u2010speed divided highway.\n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:  \n   \u2022 A (35) \u2013 No sign or surrounding roadway features indicating a 35 mph zone.  \n   \u2022 B (30) \u2013 Again, no indications of a 30 mph zone.  \n   \u2022 C (25) \u2013 Typically used in residential or heavily congested urban areas, which does not match observations.  \n   \u2022 D (60) \u2013 Supported by the clearly visible \u201cSPEED LIMIT 60\u201d sign in frames 3\u20105.\n\n4. Provide the Best Answer:  \n   The frames confirm that the speed limit is 60.\n\n<answer>D</answer>  ",
