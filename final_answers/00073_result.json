  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** At the far left of the roadway, we see a raised median and signage for a CVS on the left side of the intersection. The ego\u2019s lane is separated from the lanes on the right by a short curb or raised median, suggesting it may be a dedicated lane (often a turn lane) rather than a through lane.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** The ego lane remains clearly partitioned by the raised median to its right. Vehicles to the right are in lanes that continue straight or possibly turn right. The ego lane has no direct alignment with a through path beyond the intersection; instead, it lines up with the intersection\u2019s left\u2010turn area.\n\n3. **Frame 3:** As we advance, the painted lane lines still isolate the ego\u2019s lane from the two lanes on the right. The geometry more distinctly appears to feed into a left\u2010turn bay.\n\n4. **Frame 4:** A large white arrow marking on the pavement in the ego lane becomes visible. It is a single curved arrow pointing left, which typically indicates a dedicated left\u2010turn\u2010only lane.\n\n5. **Frame 5:** The left\u2010turn arrow on the pavement is even clearer. No forward arrow is combined with that left arrow, reinforcing that this is a left\u2010turn\u2010only lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBecause the ego lane is separated by a raised median and displays only a curving left\u2010turn arrow (with no additional straight arrow), standard traffic rules dictate that vehicles in this marked lane must turn left. If one could continue straight, the pavement markings would ordinarily show a combination arrow (straight + left).  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 **(A) Right turn only** \u2013 Not supported; the lane clearly has a left arrow, no indication of a right turn.  \n\u2022 **(B) Go straight only** \u2013 Not supported; the lane markings show a left arrow without a \u201cstraight\u201d arrow.  \n\u2022 **(C) Left turn only** \u2013 Matches the dedicated left\u2010arrow marking and separation by the raised median.  \n\u2022 **(D) Left turn and go straight** \u2013 Would require a combined arrow (both straight and left), which is not present.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
