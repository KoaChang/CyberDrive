  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: Railroad crossing gate is fully lowered, and the overhead traffic light is red. A \u201cNo Turn on Red\u201d sign is visible on the right. The pavement markings say \u201cKEEP CLEAR\u201d and \u201cKEEP\u201d repeated, likely indicating a rail crossing area.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: Conditions look nearly the same as Frame 1. The gate is still down, red lights are illuminated both for the traffic signal and on the gate.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: No significant change\u2014still downed gate, red traffic signals, same signage.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The crossing gate arms begin lifting (they are angled upward now), though the traffic light remains red.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The gates continue to rise further, but the traffic light shows red. The \u201cNo Turn on Red\u201d sign still applies, and the traffic light has not changed.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the railroad crossing gates are present (and moving from fully down to up across Frames 4\u20135) and the traffic light remains red in these frames, the driver cannot proceed just by watching one or the other alone. Even once the gates rise, the traffic light is still red, so the driver must continue to wait. Only when both the gate is fully raised (indicating the train has cleared) and the traffic light signal then turns green is it safe and legal to proceed.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (Traffic light only) \u2013 Inadequate, because ignoring a lowered gate (even if the light were green) would be dangerous.  \n\u2022 B (No Turn on Red only) \u2013 Also inadequate, as you must consider the railroad crossing condition.  \n\u2022 C (Gate arm only) \u2013 Even with the gate up, a red traffic light forbids proceeding.  \n\u2022 D (Traffic light and the gate arm) \u2013 Correct, because you need a functional green signal and an open gate.\n\n<answer>D. The traffic light and the gate arm.</answer>",
