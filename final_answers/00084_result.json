  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - We see a single\u2010lane ramp merging onto a larger roadway. Overhead signs in the distance read \u201cI\u201035 South,\u201d \u201cFrontage Rd,\u201d \u201cUniversity Blvd,\u201d and \u201c1431,\u201d although the lane assignments are not yet entirely clear from this distance. A dump truck is centered ahead of our vehicle in the same lane.\n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - Roadway signs become more legible. We can discern that \u201cFrontage Rd\u201d is to the far left, while \u201cUniversity Blvd\u201d and \u201c1431\u201d appear to be served by lanes going more straight/right. Road markings still suggest a split is coming up.\n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - The sign shows \u201cI\u201035 South / Frontage Rd\u201d with a left arrow, and then \u201cUniversity Blvd\u201d and \u201c1431\u201d with downward arrows. That usually indicates that the left fork carries you onto the frontage road, while the lanes continuing straight split again between University Blvd (center) and 1431 (far right).\n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - The truck and ego vehicle are continuing forward; the orange line to the left curves away to the I\u201035 frontage road. We can see more clearly that \u201cUniversity Blvd\u201d is the middle lane (overhead arrow downward), and \u201c1431\u201d is another lane to the right (also arrow downward).\n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - The signage directly above: \u201cI\u201035 South Frontage Rd\u201d left arrow, \u201cUniversity Blvd\u201d down arrow, and \u201c1431\u201d down arrow. The truck is in the middle lane that lines up with the \u201cUniversity Blvd\u201d arrow.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBecause we want University Blvd, the overhead signage shows we should remain in the center lane\u2014the one under \u201cUniversity Blvd.\u201d The far left is for the I\u201035 South frontage road, and the far right is for 1431. No need to turn around, and no need to change further left only to come back across to the right.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **(A) Continue lane changing to the left and keep right at the fork.**  \n  This conflicts with the overhead signs. Going left would put us on the frontage road, not University Blvd.  \n- **(B) Continue straight and keep left at the fork.**  \n  This matches the signage for University Blvd. After splitting from the frontage road on the left, we stay in/keep to the left of the two lanes that remain (the middle lane) in order to follow \u201cUniversity Blvd.\u201d  \n- **(C) Turn around.**  \n  There is no indication from the signs that we need to reverse direction.  \n- **(D) None of the above.**  \n  Not correct, since (B) is clearly supported by the signs.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
