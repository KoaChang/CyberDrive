  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** We see a multi\u2010lane downtown street with traffic moving in our direction (toward the camera). No explicit \u201cOne Way\u201d sign is visible yet, but there is a large tanker truck in the left lane, also heading the same way.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** Similar view, still nothing that directly indicates the one\u2010way direction, although the traffic flow remains consistent (all vehicles moving away from the camera in the same direction).\n\n3. **Frame 3:** The overhead traffic light and cross\u2010street signs become a bit clearer. We can see a rectangular sign above the traffic light, but it is not fully legible yet.\n\n4. **Frame 4:** Now the \u201cONE WAY\u201d sign on the overhead mast arm is more visible\u2014though slightly obscured, it appears to have an arrow pointing to the right. Traffic still flows uniformly away from the camera, with no oncoming cars.\n\n5. **Frame 5:** The \u201cONE WAY\u201d sign is easiest to read here: it has an arrow directing traffic to the right. This confirms that the cross street in front is one way going right.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**  \nAll cars (including the tanker) move in the same direction along this road; we do not see any opposing traffic lanes or cars coming toward us. The overhead sign (particularly in Frames 4 and 5) explicitly shows \u201cONE WAY\u201d with an arrow pointing to the right. Standard traffic rules dictate that such signs denote the required direction of travel on that roadway.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**  \n\u2022 A (Left) is inconsistent with the visible \u201cONE WAY \u2192\u201d signage in Frame 5.  \n\u2022 B (Right) fits exactly with the sign\u2019s arrow, showing the traffic must flow to the right.\n\n<answer>Right</answer>",
