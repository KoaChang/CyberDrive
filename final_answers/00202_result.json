  "answer": "<analysis/>\nFrom the pavement markings and the large, three\u2010arrow overhead diagram visible in frames 4\u20135, the ego vehicle is in the lane whose marking (and sign depiction) shows both a left\u2010turn arrow and a through arrow.  In other words, that lane legally allows either proceeding straight through the intersection or making a left turn.  One clue is the \u201cRIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\u201d sign off to the right (frames 1\u20132), which applies only to the far\u2010right lane.  Meanwhile, the lane the ego occupies (the next one to the left of the forced\u2010right lane) has the combined \u201cleft + straight\u201d markings on the pavement (visible faintly in frames 4\u20135) and on the overhead sign.  Hence the correct choice is \u201cStraight or Left.\u201d\n<analysis/>  \n\n<answer>B</answer>  \n\nFrame\u2010by\u2010frame reasoning:\n\n1. Frames 1\u20132:  \n   \u2022 A sign on the right says \u201cRIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT,\u201d indicating the **far\u2010right** lane is for right turns only.  \n   \u2022 The ego is clearly to the left of that forced\u2010right lane.\n\n2. Frames 3\u20134:  \n   \u2022 Traffic moves into position at the red light.  \n   \u2022 The ego\u2019s lane is neither the far\u2010left lane (which appears to be for highway/ramp travel or dedicated lefts) nor the far\u2010right forced\u2010right lane.  \n   \u2022 The middle lanes\u2019 pavement arrows are beginning to come into view.\n\n3. Frame 5:  \n   \u2022 The large overhead diagram sign shows three sets of arrows; the rightmost set in that sign depicts a through arrow and a right\u2010turn arrow (matching the forced\u2010right lane at the extreme right).  \n   \u2022 The center\u2010lane portion of that sign (the lane ego is in) has a left\u2010turn arrow and a through arrow.  \n   \u2022 Pavement markings under the black pickup also show a combined left + straight arrow.\n\nConclusion:  \nBecause the ego\u2019s lane is the one marked for both straight and left turns, the single best choice from the list\u2014Left only, Straight or Left, Straight only, Right only\u2014is  \nB. Straight or Left.",
