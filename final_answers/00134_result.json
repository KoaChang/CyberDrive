  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** Looking up toward the traffic signals, there is an overhead regulatory sign in the center of the intersection. Although not yet perfectly clear in this first frame, it appears to show a right\u2010turn arrow with a red slash (a \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d symbol). There is also an orange \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d sign farther up but no barricade clearly blocking a right turn.\n2. **Frame 2:** The overhead sign is more apparent: a circular sign above the intersection with a right\u2010turn arrow crossed out. Also visible is the standard green traffic light, so it is not the case that the traffic light alone is prohibiting the right turn (e.g., no special red arrow preventing a right turn).\n3. **Frame 3:** The \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign is increasingly obvious. Construction warning signage is on the right, but it does not extend into the intersection in a way that would block a right turn.\n4. **Frame 4:** The overhead \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d emblem is now in clear view. The lane to the right is open, and although there is a blue SUV ahead, it is simply moving through the intersection. Nothing suggests the lane is blocked specifically by that vehicle or construction cones.\n5. **Frame 5:** The sign definitively reads a right arrow with a red slash (indicating \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d). Traffic is flowing through the intersection; there is no evidence of an exclusive red traffic signal for turning right, nor is there an obstruction in the right\u2010hand lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross all frames, the critical feature is the overhead *no\u2010right\u2010turn* sign. The orange \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d placard and a nearby work zone do not physically impede turning right; rather, the city has **prohibited** the right turn, most commonly because the cross street (Pine) is one\u2010way in the opposite direction (a typical reason for placing a \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign).\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- **(A)** Blocked by construction.  \n  The images show roadwork signage, but the lane itself is not barricaded against a turn.\n\n- **(B)** One way sign.  \n  While we do not see a classic rectangular \u201cOne Way\u201d sign, the \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d sign effectively communicates that the cross street is likely one\u2010way the other direction (or otherwise disallows right turns). This is the regulatory reason.\n\n- **(C)** Traffic lights.  \n  The signal is green, so it is not a red right\u2010turn arrow or special traffic light restriction preventing a right turn.\n\n- **(D)** There is a blue car ahead.  \n  The blue SUV is simply moving straight and does not block the turn.\n\nGiven the options, the best match is that the signage (in effect a one\u2010way prohibition on turning right) is what forbids the maneuver.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
