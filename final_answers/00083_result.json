  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:**  \n   - Two through\u2010lanes are visible in the driver\u2019s direction. The camera view appears roughly centered in the rightmost of those two lanes.  \n   - On the left side of the street, there is a coffee shop and a muraled building. Signs for \u201cS 1st\u201d (the cross street\u2019s name) are up ahead.  \n   - The intersection in the distance has a standard overhead traffic light with multiple lights aligned across.  \n\n2. **Frame 2:**  \n   - The same two through\u2010lanes continue. The central double\u2010yellow lines separate oncoming traffic.  \n   - A business labeled \u201cKido\u201d is visible on the right; across from it, on the left, is a small sign for \u201cMorning Star.\u201d  \n\n3. **Frame 3:**  \n   - The roadway layout remains two lanes in each direction. No dedicated center turn lane is visible (the median lines remain double yellow).  \n   - \u201cMorning Star\u201d is very prominent on the left; \u201cKido\u201d is further to the right. This suggests that businesses lie on both sides, but notably, the left\u2010side businesses (including Polvos\u2019s block) are across the yellow lines.  \n\n4. **Frame 4:**  \n   - Approaching the intersection; no special left\u2010turn\u2010only lane is painted. The left lane continues straight (or can turn left at the intersection).  \n   - The camera\u2019s position still seems in the right lane.  \n\n5. **Frame 5:**  \n   - The intersection is close. Cars ahead in both lanes. Polvos (not directly visible in signage here) is known to be on the left side of S 1st in this stretch, across from \u201cKido.\u201d  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause Polvos is off to the left side of S 1st (where \u201cMorning Star\u201d and other businesses appear), the driver would need to be in the left lane to make that left turn. In Frames 1\u20135, the ego vehicle looks to be traveling in the right lane. Thus, simply \u201cturning left\u201d from the right lane would be improper; a lane change to the left lane is required first, then a left turn at (or just beyond) the intersection.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A. Turn left** \u2013 Incomplete; the driver is in the right lane and must first merge left.  \n- **B. Left lane change and then turn left** \u2013 Matches the situation: Polvos is on the left, so the driver must merge left and then turn.  \n- **C. Turn right** \u2013 Not consistent with Polvos being on the left side of the roadway.  \n- **D. Right lane change and then turn right** \u2013 No indication Polvos is on the right; again inconsistent.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>",
