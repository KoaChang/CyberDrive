  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The road ahead appears to terminate in a T\u2010shaped intersection (no obvious straight continuation). No prominent lane\u2010level markings (such as \u201cleft only\u201d arrows) are visible, and no signage yet indicates a forced single direction.\n2. **Frame 2:** The intersection is clearer. Still no painted turn\u2010only arrows. A sign is visible on the right but does not appear to prohibit left or right turns.\n3. **Frame 3:** Approaching closer, the view confirms a T\u2010intersection (no through route straight ahead). No \u201cRight Only\u201d or \u201cLeft Only\u201d signage is apparent.\n4. **Frame 4:** Still a single through lane, with no special turn restrictions visible. The signs on the right look to be stop signs or intersection markers for crossing/side traffic.\n5. **Frame 5:** The roadway ends in a T, and there are no arrow markings or signs restricting turns to one side only; typically, a T\u2010junction without special signs allows both left and right turns.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nSince the road simply meets a T\u2010junction and no road markings or signs force a single\u2010direction turn, the usual expectation is that both a left turn or a right turn would be permissible.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n- **A (Left turn only):** Nothing in the frames suggests you can *only* turn left.  \n- **B (Right turn only):** Nothing indicates a forced right turn.  \n- **C (Left turn and right turn):** Matches a standard T\u2010intersection with no additional restrictions.  \n- **D (None of the above):** Not correct, since a T\u2010intersection normally allows turning left or right.\n\nHence, the best choice is that you can turn either left or right from the ego\u2019s current lane.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
