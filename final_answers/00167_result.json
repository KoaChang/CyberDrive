  "answer": "1. Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:  \n   \u2022 Frame 1: The oncoming black sedan is fairly far in the distance. No obvious illumination is visible on either front corner or in the headlights.  \n   \u2022 Frame 2: Still no discernible flashing or amber light on the front corners; headlights appear off in the daytime.  \n   \u2022 Frame 3: The oncoming vehicle is closer, but neither side shows an active turn signal (no bright or blinking amber), and both headlights appear off.  \n   \u2022 Frame 4: The sedan is even nearer, and there remains no sign of a left or right signal (which would glow amber) and no sign of four\u2010way flashers (dual amber signals at the same time).  \n   \u2022 Frame 5: Immediately before passing the dashcam, nothing suggests a turn signal or headlight is on; no amber or white glow at the corners or headlights.  \n\n2. Contextual Reasoning:  \n   Because signals (left, right, or hazards) are typically amber and quite visible even in daylight, and because headlights likewise create a clear white glow or reflection, the complete absence of any such lighting in each frame strongly indicates the oncoming car has no lights activated.\n\n3. Match to Answer Choices:  \n   \u2022 A. No lights are on \u2013 consistent with all five frames.  \n   \u2022 B. Left turn light is on \u2013 contradicted by the lack of any amber light.  \n   \u2022 C. Right turn light is on \u2013 likewise no visible amber indication.  \n   \u2022 D. Hazard lights are on \u2013 would appear as flashing ambers on both sides; not observed.  \n\n4. Provide the Best Answer:  \n<answer>A. No lights are on.</answer>",
