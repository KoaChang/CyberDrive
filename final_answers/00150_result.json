  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: You can see multiple red lights straight ahead. The \u201cROAD WORK AHEAD\u201d sign is off to the right, and the lane the ego\u2010vehicle occupies has a single white arrow painted on the roadway pointing to the right.  \n2. **Frame 2**: The same arrow is visible in the ego\u2010lane, again indicating a right\u2010turn\u2010only lane. All traffic signals in the distance still appear red.  \n3. **Frame 3**: The large right\u2010turn arrow on the pavement is even clearer. The signals remain red, with the rightmost one evidently controlling the dedicated right turn.  \n4. **Frame 4**: The arrow on the road is prominent, and the overhead signal for that lane is still red. It is separate from the through\u2010lane signals, suggesting a right\u2010arrow indication rather than a circular one.  \n5. **Frame 5**: All visible signals remain red. The lane\u2019s marking continues to confirm it is right\u2010turn only, and the associated signal appears to be a red arrow rather than a red circle.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all five frames, the ego\u2010vehicle is clearly in a right\u2010turn\u2010only lane (the pavement markings confirm this). The overhead signal controlling that lane appears red through all frames. Because it is a dedicated right\u2010turn lane, the relevant signal is typically a right\u2010turn arrow rather than a standard circular indication.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (\u201cRed Left Arrow\u201d) is inconsistent: the lane markings indicate a right turn, not left.  \n\u2022 B (\u201cRed Circle\u201d) does not fit because there is a separate red arrow for the right turn lane.  \n\u2022 C (\u201cGreen Circle\u201d) is contradicted by the visible red signals.  \n\u2022 D (\u201cRed Right Arrow\u201d) matches both the red color and the dedicated right\u2010turn lane\u2019s signal shape.  \n\u2022 E (\u201cGreen Left Arrow\u201d) conflicts with both the color (the lights are red) and the turn direction (it\u2019s a right turn).  \n\nTherefore, the best match is:  \n<answer>D. Red Right Arrow</answer>",
