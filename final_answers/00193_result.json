  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** The car\u2019s standard nighttime tail lamps are illuminated, but neither the left nor the right lamp appears brighter or flashing. There is no separate signal indication on either side.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** Again, both red tail lamps are visible at the same intensity, suggesting no active blinker.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The lighting remains unchanged from Frame 2; there is no on/off cycling that would signify a turn signal or hazard lights.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** The red tail lamps are still uniformly lit; no one side flickers or becomes brighter.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** Same uniform red glow on both rear lamps, with no evident blinking on either side.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nA turn signal (left or right) would typically appear noticeably brighter or flash intermittently on that side. Hazard lights would flash both sides in unison. Across these five frames\u2014spaced about one second apart\u2014there is no sign of a flashing pattern or a single side being brighter.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA or B (right or left signal) would show some flashing difference on that side; D (hazards) would show simultaneous left-and-right blinking. None of these are visible. That leaves C, that the blinkers are off\u2014and the car is simply running with its normal tail lights on at night.  \n\n<answer>C</answer>",
