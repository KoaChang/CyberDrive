  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: No clearly visible pedestrians. The scene shows parked cars along the curb and some buildings, but no one on foot is apparent.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: Essentially the same view straight ahead; still no pedestrians evident on the sidewalks.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Two people come into view on the right\u2010hand sidewalk near the corner (one wearing darker clothing, the other in red).  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: Those same two pedestrians remain visible on the right\u2010hand sidewalk.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: Again, the same two pedestrians are visible on the right\u2010hand sidewalk; no additional pedestrians appear anywhere else in the frame.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the five frames, only those two pedestrians appear at any time, and they are consistently the same two individuals. No other pedestrians come into frame.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d does not match the observed two people.  \n\u2022 \u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d is unsupported by what the frames show.  \n\u2022 \u201c2\u201d is exactly how many unique pedestrians are visible.\n\n<answer>C. 2.</answer>",
