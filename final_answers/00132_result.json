  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1 and Frame 2**: The roadway is multi\u2010lane, divided by a raised median. There are no immediately visible speed\u2010limit signs at this distance; the most prominent features are the residential fencing to the left and the \u201cFairway Ridge\u201d sign on the right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: A small, square\u2010shaped signpost (just ahead on the right) starts to come into clearer view, but the text is not yet fully legible.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: That same sign is now more readable\u2014it shows a rectangular shape typical of a speed limit sign, and appears to say \u201c40.\u201d  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The sign is clearly identifiable as a **Speed Limit 40** sign alongside the right curb.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross Frames 1 to 3, you see the sign in the distance. By Frame 4 and especially Frame 5, the \u201cSpeed Limit 40\u201d text comes into clear view. No other speed limit postings are seen in frames before that sign.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n(A) 30, (B) 35, or (D) 45 would contradict the plainly visible \u201cSpeed Limit 40\u201d sign in Frame 4 and Frame 5. Hence, (C) 40 mph is the correct limit.\n\n<answer>C. 40 mph.</answer>",
