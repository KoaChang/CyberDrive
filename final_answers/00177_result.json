  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** We are approaching an intersection where the roadway bends slightly to the right. Across the intersection to the left is a \u201cONE WAY\u201d sign with its arrow pointing left along the cross street; however, no definitive turn\u2010restriction signs are fully visible in this first view.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The \u201cONE WAY\u201d sign to the left is clearer; it does not by itself prohibit turning left but rather indicates that side street is one\u2010way in that direction. Still, we begin to see additional signs near the signal that may be turn restrictions.  \n3. **Frame 3:** More clearly in front, there are circular \u201cno turn\u201d symbols (arrows with red slashes) posted near the traffic lights. It appears there is a \u201cno left turn\u201d symbol and what looks like a \u201cno right turn\u201d symbol.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The two prohibition signs become more evident: one forbids a left turn, the other forbids a right turn.  \n5. **Frame 5:** Both the \u201cno left turn\u201d and \u201cno right turn\u201d signs are plainly visible just ahead; there is no corresponding \u201cno straight\u201d sign. This establishes that both left and right turns are disallowed, so proceeding **straight** is the legal option.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom the progression of frames, it becomes clear that, although the cross street to the left is a one\u2010way, there are explicit signs at the intersection prohibiting both left and right turns. Consequently, the only permitted movement is to continue straight.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A (Straight) \u2013 Consistent with the visible \u201cno turn\u201d signs.  \n- B (Left) \u2013 Conflict with the posted \u201cno left turn\u201d sign.  \n- C (Right) \u2013 Conflict with the posted \u201cno right turn\u201d sign.  \n- D (All of the Above) \u2013 Not possible, as both left and right are explicitly prohibited.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>",
