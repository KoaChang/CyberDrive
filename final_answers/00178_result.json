  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** The bicyclist appears ahead of the ego vehicle, roughly near the middle of the lane, with a red reflector or taillight facing the camera. This suggests the bicyclist is pointing away from the ego vehicle rather than toward it.  \n2. **Frame 2:** The bicyclist remains in front of the ego vehicle, still showing the rear of the bike and continuing up the hill.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The bicyclist has moved slightly further along the same uphill path. Again, the bicycle\u2019s rear\u2010facing light/reflector is visible.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The bicyclist continues on the same path; no indication of crossing left\u2010to\u2010right or right\u2010to\u2010left across the frame.  \n5. **Frame 5:** The bicyclist is still ahead, traveling on the same side of the road in the same uphill direction as the ego vehicle.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nIn each consecutive frame, the bicyclist is seen ahead on the same side of the road, traveling up the hill, showing a rear light or reflector. That confirms the rider is traveling *away from* the camera rather than coming *toward* it or moving laterally across the camera\u2019s view.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- **A: Same direction as ego.** Consistent with the frames, as the cyclist is always ahead and facing away from the camera.  \n- **B: Opposite direction from ego.** Would show a headlight or the front of the bicycle approaching, which we do not see.  \n- **C: From left to right.** The cyclist maintains forward travel in the lane, not crossing left to right.  \n- **D: From right to left.** Same as above\u2014no lateral crossing is evident.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>",
