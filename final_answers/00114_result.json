  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The camera faces a multi\u2010lane intersection at night. Roadway signage is somewhat distant, but you can see a posted sign ahead near the center island. The lane markings are not entirely clear yet from this view.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The middle of the lane has a painted arrow that appears to curve gently forward/right. You can also see a rectangular sign on a post (to the center\u2010right) that shows one arrow pointing straight and another arrow pointing right (though it is still small in this frame).  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The forward\u2010facing arrow is more distinct in the lane. Its slight curve aligns with going mostly straight with a mild bend in the roadway. That same rectangular sign, now more visible, combines an \u201cup\u201d arrow and a \u201cright\u201d arrow.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The curved lane marking on the pavement clearly guides cars forward (with a mild curve to the left side of the intersection), but the posted sign dashboard\u2010center reads as \u201c\u2191 and \u2192,\u201d confirming two permissible directions: proceed ahead or turn right.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The posted sign is clearest here (straight arrow on the left side of the sign, right arrow on the right). No arrow on that sign points left. This matches the lane markings that guide traffic either straight on this bend or to the right.  \n\nContextual Reasoning:\n\n\u2022 The key detail is that posted regulatory sign in frames 2\u20135. Its dual arrow\u2014one pointing straight, one pointing right\u2014explicitly shows allowable directions from the current lane.  \n\u2022 Although the actual roadway curves a bit, that slight curvature is not a left\u2010turn lane (and there is no marked arrow for turning left).  \n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\n\n\u2022 A. Left only \u2013 Contradicted by the sign, which shows forward and right, not left.  \n\u2022 B. Straight only \u2013 Contradicted by the sign pointing both straight and right.  \n\u2022 C. Right only \u2013 Again contradicted by the sign, which includes a straight (up) arrow as well.  \n\u2022 D. Straight and right \u2013 This precisely matches the sign and the painted arrow markings.  \n\n<answer>D. Straight and right</answer>",
