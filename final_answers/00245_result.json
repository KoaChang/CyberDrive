  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** Two through\u2010lanes are visible with a separated bike lane on the far right (marked by vertical pylons). Orange diamond \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d signs appear in the distance on the right shoulder.\n\n2. **Frame 2:** The same \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d signs become clearer, and a second orange sign behind them appears. The right\u2010most lane is still protected by the pylons (likely the bike lane).\n\n3. **Frame 3:** We can now see there are multiple warning signs on the right, including one that reads \u201cBike Lane Closed Ahead.\u201d An arrow board (the black rectangular panel with flashing lights) is just barely visible farther ahead.\n\n4. **Frame 4:** The arrow board is more prominent; its lights form a directional arrow pointing left, standard for indicating a right\u2010lane closure (or obstruction) requiring leftward merging.\n\n5. **Frame 5:** \u201cBike Lane Closed Ahead\u201d is clearly visible, and the arrow board at the far right is indeed flashing a left\u2010pointing pattern, directing traffic to move out of the right\u2010hand side.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nThe key signage is the blinking arrow board (commonly used in work zones). It sits near or in the right lane and flashes a left\u2010pointing arrow, indicating vehicles in the right lane should move left. Since it is telling drivers to merge away from the right side, the maneuver is to make a **left** lane change (or continue leftward if you were in the right lane).\n\n\u201cStop ahead\u201d clearly does not match the arrow board\u2019s message, and \u201cno action required\u201d fails to address the closure indicated. A \u201cright lane change\u201d would be advised only if a left lane were closed, but the arrow board is plainly pointing left, so the lane closure is on the right.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (Stop ahead) \u2013 Not supported by the flashing arrow board.  \n\u2022 B (Right lane change ahead) \u2013 Would only apply if the left lane were closed, which the signage contradicts.  \n\u2022 C (No action required) \u2013 Conflicts with the obvious merge/arrow message.  \n\u2022 D (Left lane change ahead) \u2013 Matches the standard meaning of a right\u2010lane closure arrow board pointing traffic left.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
