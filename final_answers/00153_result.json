  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1 and 2:** The SUV (ego\u2019s lane) is to the right of a pickup that is clearly in a dedicated left\u2010turn lane.  The lane\u2010marking visible in front of the SUV has a slight leftward bend rather than a standard \u201cstraight\u201d arrow, suggesting that continuing \u201cstraight\u201d on this road actually involves angling left through the intersection.  \n2. **Frame 3 and 4:** Overhead, the two signals serving the SUV\u2019s lane both illuminate green arrows angled left (rather than a simple green circle), matching that angled\u2010left \u201cthrough\u201d path.  Meanwhile, the far\u2010left lanes have their own separate left\u2010turn arrows, and the far\u2010right lane has a right\u2010turn arrow.  \n3. **Frame 5:** With the SUV now beginning to roll forward, the overhead signals directly above it remain green angled\u2010left arrows.  There is no plain green circle controlling the SUV\u2019s lane; the relevant \u201cstraight\u2010ahead\u201d movement at this intersection is actually marked by a diagonal (angled) green arrow.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the main through\u2010movement at this particular intersection veers left (rather than going straight at a right angle), the traffic signal that applies to the driver\u2019s lane is not a normal \u201ccircular\u201d green but instead a green arrow pointing diagonally to the left.\n\n**Matching to the Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (Green Circle) is ruled out because the signal above the ego lane is not a simple circle.  \n\u2022 B (Green Left Arrow) might sound close but these signals are clearly angled diagonally (rather than a horizontal or vertical arrow).  \n\u2022 C (Green Right Arrow) is not correct; that applies to the turn lane on the far right.  \n\u2022 D (Green Diagonal Left Arrow) fits what is shown overhead for the ego\u2019s lane.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
