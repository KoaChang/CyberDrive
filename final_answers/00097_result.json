  "answer": "Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: From a distance, we can see an orange diamond\u2010shaped sign on the right side of the roadway. Orange diamond\u2010shaped signs generally indicate construction or temporary traffic control.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: The sign remains at a distance, still visibly orange and diamond\u2010shaped; no exact text is readable yet.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: Closer in view, the sign still appears as a typical roadway work zone sign.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The sign is more legible and aligns with the standard \u201cROAD WORK AHEAD\u201d message used for upcoming construction.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The text on the orange diamond sign becomes fully clear: \u201cROAD WORK AHEAD.\u201d\n\nContextual Reasoning:\nDiamond\u2010shaped signs often warn drivers of construction or maintenance activity, especially when they are orange. \u201cStop\u201d and \u201cYield\u201d use different shapes (octagon for stop, downward triangle for yield), and \u201cSchool Zone\u201d signs are typically a pentagon or a fluorescent yellow\u2010green diamond, not bright orange.\n\nMatch to Answer Choices:\nA. Stop \u2013 Incorrect shape and color.  \nB. Yield \u2013 Incorrect shape and color.  \nC. School Zone \u2013 Typically a pentagon (fluorescent green/yellow), not orange.  \nD. Road Work Ahead \u2013 Matches an orange diamond sign warning of construction.\n\nProvide the Best Answer:\n<answer>D. Road Work Ahead.</answer>",
