  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: Road ahead is fairly straight, no traffic signals visible. On the right appears to be a sign with a circular arrow pattern, suggesting a roundabout sign.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The circular\u2010arrows sign on the right is clearer, and just beneath it is a yield\u2010triangle shape. No stop signs or traffic lights are evident.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: The same roundabout sign is more noticeable; there are no signals overhead or cross streets that would form a classic T\u2010junction.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: The roundabout sign and yield sign are in plain view; the roadway ahead veers slightly to the right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The lane dividers curve toward what looks like a small traffic circle. Again, no traffic light or stop signs in sight.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the frames, the signage consistently shows a roundabout diagram and a yield sign. There is no overhead traffic signal, nor are there multiple stop signs indicating an all\u2010way stop. This is not simply a T\u2010junction because the signage and roadway design point to a circular intersection.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. All Way Stop** \u2013 No stop signs are visible, so unlikely.  \n\u2022 **B. Traffic Light Controlled** \u2013 No signals or lights are apparent.  \n\u2022 **C. T\u2010junction** \u2013 The signage and roadway do not support a pure T\u2010shaped intersection; also the roundabout sign says otherwise.  \n\u2022 **D. Roundabout** \u2013 The repeated circular\u2010arrow sign, yield signs, and the roadway layout all point to this.  \n\n<answer>D. Roundabout</answer>",
