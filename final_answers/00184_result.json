  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** The intersection is visible at the bottom of the hill under red lights; a large truck or van crosses from left to right, but that vehicle appears to be part of cross\u2010traffic, not queued in the left\u2010turn lane. No obvious left\u2010lane queue is visible yet.  \n2. **Frame 2:** A black SUV directly ahead of the ego vehicle is aligned with a left\u2010turn arrow (visible faintly on the roadway); no second vehicle is in front of that SUV in the same lane.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The black SUV remains positioned where the left\u2010turn arrow is painted, and no car can be seen queued ahead of it in that lane. The white sedan crossing is through\u2010traffic, not part of a left\u2010turn queue.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The lane markings confirm a left arrow, and the same single black SUV is in that lane. Again, no additional vehicles directly in front of the SUV are visible.  \n5. **Frame 5:** A large bus crosses as well, but it is turning or crossing from a different approach. The black SUV is still the only car identifiable in the left\u2010turn lane ahead of ego.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom each frame, the black SUV appears to be alone in the designated left\u2010turn lane: although other vehicles pass through the intersection, they seem to be either traveling straight or part of crossing traffic. No additional cars occupy the SUV\u2019s lane in front of it.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (0 cars) is inconsistent because we do see at least one SUV ahead.  \n\u2022 B (1 car) fits the evidence: only the black SUV is ahead in the left\u2010turn lane.  \n\u2022 C (2 cars) or D (3 cars) are not supported by the frames; there is no sign of more than one car queued in that turn lane.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
