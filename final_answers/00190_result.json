  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** shows a green traffic light straight ahead. No pedestrians appear to be in the crosswalk.  \n2. **Frame 2** still shows the same green light; again, no obvious pedestrian or speedbump.  \n3. **Frame 3** continues to show the traffic light green. Road surface looks unchanged, with no bumps or humps indicated.  \n4. **Frame 4** reveals that the top lens of the signal (normally the red lens in a vertical stack) is lit. Although the color looks somewhat dark or amber\u2010toned, its position indicates that it is the red light.  \n5. **Frame 5** confirms that same top lens is lit, so the signal is red. The crosswalk is empty, ruling out a pedestrian hazard, and no speedbump signage or markings are visible.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nFrom frames 1\u20133 the signal is green, then by frames 4\u20135 the top lens is clearly lit, indicating it has changed from green to red. No pedestrians or speedbumps are present. The light\u2019s change is the direct cause for slowing/stopping.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- A (Light turned yellow): The light is actually red in frames 4 and 5 (the top lens).  \n- B (Light turned red): Matches what we see\u2014it changed from green to red.  \n- C (Yielding for a pedestrian): No one is in the crosswalk.  \n- D (Speedbump ahead): No sign or marking for a bump.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
