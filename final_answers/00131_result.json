  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** At top\u2010left, there are two red arrow lamps clearly facing left (for the protected left\u2010turn lanes). The signal heads above the through/right lanes are more central in the image, and they appear to show a high, single red \u201cball\u201d (circular) indication rather than an arrow.  \n2. **Frames 2\u20135:** The same overall arrangement persists\u2014two red left\u2010arrow signals for the left\u2010turn lane and a separate red circular indication for the through and/or right lane(s). No right\u2010arrow signal head is visible off to the right.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the ego vehicle is in the right\u2010most lane, the relevant signal is the one controlling through and right\u2010turn movement, rather than the left\u2010turn arrows. Across all frames, that signal is a standard circular red, not an arrow.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 **A. Red Right Arrow** \u2013 No separate right arrow is visible; the red arrows observed face left.  \n\u2022 **B. Red Left Arrow** \u2013 That applies only to the left\u2010turn lanes, not the right\u2010most lane.  \n\u2022 **C. Red Circle** \u2013 Matches the circular red \u201cball\u201d signal controlling the right\u2010most lane.  \n\u2022 **D. Yellow Left Arrow** \u2013 Irrelevant to the right\u2010most lane and not shown in the frames.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>  ",
