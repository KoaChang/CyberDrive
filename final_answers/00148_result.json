  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1**: We see a four\u2010way intersection with stop signs on the right. Bright orange \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d signage and construction barriers are visible in the center of the road straight ahead.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2**: The \u201cRoad Work Ahead\u201d sign and barricades (\u201cRoad Closed / Thru Traffic\u201d sign) become more legible. There is clear evidence of a work zone blocking the lane(s) going forward.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3**: Construction vehicles and equipment are present beyond the barricades. The sign \u201cROAD CLOSED / THRU TRAFFIC\u201d indicates the road directly ahead cannot be used for normal through travel.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4**: A better view of the closure: a large orange barrier spans most of the street. A sign specifically says the road is \u201cclosed\u201d to through traffic.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5**: The closure remains directly in front of the driver (ego). The continuing presence of signage, cones, and heavy equipment confirms that the route ahead is inaccessible.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross the five frames, the orange barriers and \u201cRoad Closed to Thru Traffic\u201d sign clearly show that going straight is disallowed due to ongoing construction. This is the most pertinent fact that would make it inappropriate for the ego vehicle to travel straight.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A. Another vehicle pulling out of a driveway: While there are other vehicles, the critical factor here is not a driveway conflict.  \n\u2022 B. Road ahead is blocked by construction: Matches the photographic evidence of barricades, signage, and a marked closure.  \n\u2022 C. This intersection is a T\u2010junction: It does not appear to be a T\u2010junction\u2014it is a normal four\u2010way intersection.  \n\u2022 D. It is appropriate to go straight: Contradicted by the closure signage and barriers.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>",
