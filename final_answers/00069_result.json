  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1:** The camera is facing forward on a multi-lane highway at night. Up ahead on the right side there is a large overhead green sign indicating upcoming exits. It is hard to read in this first frame, but the sign seems to mention \u201cBelt Line Rd / Arapaho Rd.\u201d  \n2. **Frame 2:** We see clearer text on the road surface in the ego\u2019s lane\u2014white letters reading \u201cONLY.\u201d Meanwhile, the overhead sign now more clearly reads \u201cBelt Line Rd / Arapaho Rd / EXIT ONLY\u201d and is aligned with the lane in which the ego-vehicle is traveling.  \n3. **Frame 3:** The sign above the lane is fully readable: \u201cBelt Line Rd / Arapaho Rd / EXIT ONLY,\u201d with an arrow directing traffic off the highway. You can also see the roadway markings diverging from the main lanes, reinforcing that the ego\u2019s lane is specifically for exiting.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The overhead sign again shows \u201cBelt Line Rd / Arapaho Rd / EXIT ONLY.\u201d The dashed white line to the left suggests the exit lane is splitting away from the through lanes.  \n5. **Frame 5:** As the ego-vehicle continues in the same lane, the large exit sign overhead confirms that the lane leads off the highway to Belt Line Rd / Arapaho Rd. Next to that exit sign is a bright yellow plaque with \u201cEXIT 35\u201d and an arrow indicating the ramp.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross these frames, the key point is the \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d labeling\u2014both overhead signage and road surface text. The white lettering \u201cONLY\u201d in the lane further confirms that vehicles in this lane are required to exit rather than continue straight. There are no indications of a forced full stop or a left-turn interchange; nor do we see any reason for vehicles to remain on the highway if they stay in this right lane.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A. **Exit the highway.** Consistent with the \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d signage and the marked lane.  \n- B. **Come to a full stop.** No indication of a stop sign or traffic light forcing vehicles to stop.  \n- C. **Continue on the highway.** The \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d marking contradicts staying on the highway.  \n- D. **Turn Left.** This is an exit ramp to the right; there is no left-turn signage.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>  ",
