  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** Cones appear toward the right side of the roadway in a tapered pattern, starting near the curb and extending inward. The left side of the road remains unimpeded. It looks like one lane (the far\u2010right lane) is coned off.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2:** The cones continue in a line almost parallel to the curb, clearly occupying the space of the rightmost driving lane, while the center and left lanes remain open.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3:** Still one lane is being channeled away by the cones; the other lanes are free of cones.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4:** Only a single cone remains closer to center in the right lane, reinforcing that the same single lane is coned off.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5:** No other lanes besides that one far\u2010right lane are closed or visibly obstructed; traffic flows forward in at least one middle or left lane.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nFrom all five frames, the coned area stays consistently to the right and does not encroach on the other lanes. While there may be parking on the left, the traveling lanes remain otherwise open except for the single lane that is blocked by the cones.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA (0 lanes) is contradicted by the clear presence of cones.  \nB (1 lane) aligns with seeing only the rightmost lane closed off.  \nC (2 lanes) and D (3 lanes) are not supported by the visuals, which show no other lane besides the right one blocked or obstructed.  \n\n<answer>B</answer>",
