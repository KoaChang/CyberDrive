  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n1. **Frame 1:** A white sedan (Prius) appears crossing from the left side of the dashcam\u2019s view toward the right (its front end is on the left, moving rightward).  \n2. **Frame 2:** The road is momentarily clear; you can see lane markings and a street sign for \u201cCrossover Drive\u201d off to the right.  \n3. **Frame 3:** Another car briefly comes into view on the lower right, again appearing to move from left to right as it exits the frame.  \n4. **Frame 4:** A white Prius again traverses from left to right, similar to Frame 1.  \n5. **Frame 5 (Crucial for the Bus):** The bus is clearly visible, occupying roughly the middle of the frame. Its front is on the left half of the image and its rear is on the right half, with noticeable left\u2010to\u2010right motion blur.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\n\u2022 In each instance where a vehicle is visible (Frames 1, 3, 4, and finally 5), they proceed across the dashcam\u2019s field of view in the same left\u2010to\u2010right orientation.  \n\u2022 By the time the bus is fully in view (Frame 5), its orientation confirms it is traveling laterally across the camera\u2019s forward perspective\u2014from the left edge of the scene to the right.\n\n**Answer Choice Match:**\n\u2022 It is not going the same or opposite direction as ego in a fore\u2013aft sense (A/B), since it is plainly crossing the field of view sideways.  \n\u2022 The bus is not traveling right\u2010to\u2010left; rather, each frame shows vehicles proceeding left\u2010to\u2010right, with the bus in Frame 5 doing the same.\n\n<answer>D. Left to right</answer>",
