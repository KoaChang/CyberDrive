  "answer": "1. FRAME\u2010BY\u2010FRAME ANALYSIS  \n   \u2022 Frame 1: The roadway curves to the right. A double yellow centerline separates oncoming traffic. The line to the right of the centerline (separating the left and right travel lanes) appears white with visible breaks\u2014i.e., a dashed or \u201cdotted\u201d white line.  \n   \u2022 Frame 2: Similar view. The same broken white line is visible to the right of center, indicating the boundary between the left lane (where the camera/ego seems to be) and the right lane (where the white coupe is traveling).  \n   \u2022 Frame 3: Close\u2010up of the same pattern\u2014double yellow centerline on the far left, dashed white line dividing the two lanes traveling in the camera\u2019s direction.  \n   \u2022 Frame 4: The dashed segments remain evident; there is no solid white line on the lane\u2010to\u2010lane boundary.  \n   \u2022 Frame 5: Same markings\u2014double yellow in the center, and the lane\u2010to\u2010lane separation is still the same dashed (dotted) white line.  \n\n2. CONTEXTUAL REASONING  \n   Because these frames show two lanes in the same direction, standard U.S. conventions would call for a white line dividing them, not yellow (that is for opposite\u2010direction or left\u2010edge markings). Additionally, the line is clearly broken/dotted\u2014one can see the short segments rather than one continuous stripe.  \n\n3. MATCH TO ANSWER CHOICES  \n   \u2022 Solid white line (A) would typically denote the right shoulder or a \u201cdo not cross\u201d boundary, which is not what we see between these two lanes.  \n   \u2022 Solid yellow line (B) and Double yellow line (C) are used to mark opposite\u2010direction lanes or left edges, so they do not apply here.  \n   \u2022 Dotted white line (D) matches exactly the dashed white lane\u2010divider visible in each frame.  \n\n4.
