  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1** shows the ego vehicle centered in one of two through\u2010lanes. Up ahead on the right, there is an additional lane separated by a dashed line in some parts and signed for HOV use (though the exact text isn\u2019t fully legible yet). A green street sign for \u201cAnza\u201d is not visible in this first frame.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2** still shows the same two through\u2010lanes with fairly heavy traffic ahead. The HOV signage at the far right becomes a bit clearer, indicating that the right\u2010most lane is indeed designated an HOV lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3** clearly shows a posted \u201cHOV 2+ ONLY\u201d sign to the right. Also visible now is a speed\u2010limit sign (35 mph) and a green street sign for \u201cAnza\u201d at the intersection ahead.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4** continues to show the HOV\u2010lane sign on the right, as well as the Anza street sign overhead. The traffic signal is visible in the distance.  \n\u2022 **Frame 5** confirms that the intersection just ahead is labeled \u201cAnza,\u201d meaning the very next intersection is indeed Anza Street.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nBecause the ego vehicle wants to turn right at this upcoming intersection (Anza Street), the normal rule is to be in the right\u2010most lane to make a right turn. Even though that lane is signed as an HOV or carpool lane, in most jurisdictions single\u2010occupant vehicles are permitted to enter a right\u2010side HOV lane when preparing to turn right. Nothing in the frames suggests that turning from the center lane is allowed, and the signage indicates we are, in fact, approaching Anza now (not some earlier intersection).\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. \u201cEgo should directly turn right from the current lane \u2026\u201d \u2013 Normally you must move into the right lane to turn right; turning from the center lane is unsafe and usually illegal.  \nB. \u201cEgo should immediately lane change to the right lane and then turn right.\u201d \u2013 This follows standard practice; one may briefly enter an HOV lane on the right for the purpose of turning.  \nC. \u201cEgo can\u2019t lane change to the right lane because that is an HOV lane.\u201d \u2013 HOV lanes typically allow single\u2010occupant drivers to merge into them to execute a right turn, so this is incorrect.  \nD. \u201cEgo should proceed \u2026 it\u2019s not Anza street yet.\u201d \u2013 The signage in several frames shows that the approaching intersection is indeed Anza, so this is not correct.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>B</answer>",
