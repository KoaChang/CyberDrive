  "answer": "Frame-by-Frame Analysis  \n\u2022 Frame 1: The roadway is a multi\u2010lane surface street with commercial establishments (e.g., a Chili\u2019s and IHOP) on the right. No immediate speed sign is sharply in focus here, but you can see a rectangular sign up ahead on the right.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: That rectangular sign becomes clearer and appears to read \u201cSpeed Limit 50.\u201d  \n\u2022 Frame 3: The \u201cSpeed Limit 50\u201d sign on the right is now fully visible.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: Again, the \u201cSpeed Limit 50\u201d sign is quite prominent on the right shoulder.  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The same sign is still visible as the dashcam moves past it.  \n\nContextual Reasoning  \nAll frames show the same stretch of road with consistent signage. The very visible posted \u201cSpeed Limit 50\u201d sign confirms the speed limit on this arterial roadway.  \n\nMatch to Answer Choices  \n\u2022 A (25), B (35), or C (45) do not match the clearly posted \u201cSpeed Limit 50\u201d sign.  \n\u2022 D (50) aligns perfectly with the sign markings observed in multiple frames.  \n\nProvide the Best Answer  \nBased on the repeated appearance of the \u201cSpeed Limit 50\u201d sign, the best choice is:  \n<answer>D</answer>",
