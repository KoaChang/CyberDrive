  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** From a distance, we can see multiple lanes, but the rightmost lane is already beginning to arc toward the right. No clearly visible arrows yet.  \n2. **Frame 2:** As we get closer, the rightmost lane continues to curve away. The lane lines suggest it is separating from the through lanes.  \n3. **Frame 3:** A faint white arrow begins to appear in the rightmost lane, indicating a dedicated right turn. The middle lanes appear to remain straight.  \n4. **Frame 4:** The right lane shows a clearly marked right\u2010turn arrow on the pavement. The adjacent lane to its left does **not** show a right\u2010turn or combination arrow; it lines up to continue straight through the intersection.  \n5. **Frame 5:** Very clearly, only the far\u2010right lane has a painted right\u2010turn arrow. The next lane over is aligned to go straight (it does not share the turn).\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross these five frames, we see that the lone marked turn lane is on the far right. The second lane from the right remains oriented straight ahead, and there are no visible arrows or signage indicating that any other lane also turns right.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A. \u201c1 lane\u201d aligns with the single dedicated right\u2010turn lane observed.  \n\u2022 B, C, D would require at least one (or more) additional marked right\u2010turn lane(s), which the frames do not show.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>",
