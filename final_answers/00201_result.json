  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The signal over the lane nearest the camera (the ego lane) is clearly lit red and clearly formed as a left arrow. There is also a red circular signal higher up (near the \u201cBryant\u201d street sign), but that appears farther away than the bright red arrow facing the ego vehicle.  \n2. **Frame 2**: As vehicles pass, the same prominent red arrow to the left remains illuminated; the circular red light up near the street sign remains above and farther away.  \n3. **Frame 3**: Traffic continues to move through the intersection, but the red arrow is still visibly lit and is closest to the dashcam viewpoint.  \n4. **Frame 4**: The arrow remains a bright red left arrow.  \n5. **Frame 5**: The situation is virtually unchanged; the red arrow is still the closest active traffic light to the driver.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 Although there is also a standard red circular signal higher up, the low-mounted, red, left\u2010pointing arrow is the traffic light closest to the ego vehicle.  \n\u2022 It is distinctly arrow-shaped (not a circle), and its color remains red throughout the frames.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A (Red Circle) is incorrect, since the light nearest to ego is arrow\u2010shaped.  \n- B (Red Right Arrow) is incorrect, as the arrow is pointing left.  \n- C (Red Left Arrow) matches our frame analysis.  \n- D (Yellow Circle) and E (Yellow Left Arrow) are incorrect because the illuminated color is red, not yellow.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
