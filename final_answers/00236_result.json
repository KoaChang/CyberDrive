  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 The camera is looking down a roadway with streetcar rails running along the left. Cars visible ahead in the same direction of travel are all lined up single\u2010file (no side\u2010by\u2010side traffic). Parked cars are along the right curb, but no markings or width suggest a second through\u2010lane there.  \n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 Still single\u2010file traffic; no center or lane\u2010divider stripe defining separate lanes. The trolley tracks hug the left curb/sidewalk.  \n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 Same configuration: a single line of moving vehicles in the center, parked cars on the right, and trolley rails (not a vehicle lane) on the left.  \n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 No sign of a second travel lane; traffic ahead remains in one column, with rails and sidewalk along the left and parked cars on the right.  \n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 The pattern persists: one continuous open driving path, rails to the left, and parking on the right shoulder.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBecause the only moving vehicles in all frames occupy one continuous path and there are no painted lines or side\u2010by\u2010side traffic, there appears to be **only one drivable lane** in this direction. The rails on the left do not appear to be used (or marked) as a separate car lane, and the row of parked cars on the right leaves insufficient space for a second lane.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 A (1 lane) aligns with the single\u2010file flow we observe.  \n\u2022 B (2 lanes) would require two side\u2010by\u2010side lanes or markings. The images do not show that.  \n\u2022 C (3 lanes) and D (4 lanes) are clearly out of scope given the visible roadway.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
