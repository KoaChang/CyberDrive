  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**\n\n- **Frame 1:** The roadway appears to be at least three lanes wide (in our direction of travel), and there are construction barrels on the far right shoulder. No clear indication yet of which lane is blocked, though orange signs are visible farther ahead.  \n- **Frame 2:** The center lines are still intact in the middle, but cones and signage are more apparent beyond the intersection. Ahead, in the distance, a row of traffic cones is starting to line up near the center, though it\u2019s not fully clear how the lane closures will shape up yet.  \n- **Frame 3:** On the right, there are orange advance warning signs. One of them reads something akin to \u201cTHRU TRAFFIC MERGE RIGHT,\u201d suggesting that middle or left lanes might be constrained. The cones up ahead are placed roughly in the center portion of the road.  \n- **Frame 4:** The large orange construction sign on the right shoulder clearly reads \u201cCenter Lane Closed.\u201d Directly ahead, the cones are arranged squarely in the center lane.  \n- **Frame 5:** The cones continue straight through the center lane, preventing traffic from traveling there. You can see vehicles forced to use the left and/or right lanes around the coned-off area.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nFrom the progression of signs and the placement of traffic cones, it\u2019s clear that the center lane is being taken out of service due to the construction activity. The presence of the specific \u201cCenter Lane Closed\u201d sign in Frame 4, and the line of cones continuing in that lane in Frame 5, confirms that the center lane is indeed blocked.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- A (Left lane blocked): The left lane does not appear to be coned off.  \n- B (Center lane blocked): This aligns with both the \u201cCenter Lane Closed\u201d sign and the physical barrier of cones.  \n- C (Right lane blocked): Though there are barrels to the right, traffic is still flowing in the right lane.  \n- D (None of the above): The signage and cones clearly show a closure, so this is not correct.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
