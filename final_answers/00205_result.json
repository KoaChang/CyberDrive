  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 We see an upcoming overpass to the left and a set of green highway signs up ahead. Nothing here yet definitively shows which lanes go to 290E, but we do note that traffic (including our \u201cego\u201d vehicle) is generally organizing, with more cars favoring the left/middle.\n\n2. **Frame 2** \u2013 A closer look at the overhead ramp structure coming in from the left. Still no clear lane\u2010only markings on the pavement, but the green signs in the distance suggest 290/71 splits off somewhere ahead to the left.\n\n3. **Frame 3** \u2013 Traffic spacing makes it clearer that the left lanes are angling toward a ramp. The overhead sign (partially visible) references \u201c290\u201d and \u201c71\u201d together, indicating a left turn (or leftward exit).\n\n4. **Frame 4** \u2013 Now we begin to see large road markings reading \u201cONLY\u201d across two left lanes, each with a left\u2010turn arrow. This strongly indicates that 290 (and/or 71) is accessed by turning left.\n\n5. **Frame 5** \u2013 The final frame confirms two left\u2010turn\u2010only lanes with \u201cONLY\u201d and big curved arrows. The roadside sign also says \u201cEAST 290 / 71\u201d with a left arrow. Hence, to head to 290 East, drivers must be in one of these two left\u2010turn lanes.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross the sequence, the signage and pavement markings become more explicit: lanes to the left have \u201cONLY\u201d with left\u2010turn arrows, and the signs for \u201c290 East\u201d point left. The right and middle lanes continue straight or to other highways. Thus, to get onto 290E, one must be in the leftmost (or second\u2010from\u2010left) \u201cONLY\u201d lane.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**\n\n- (A) **Right\u2010most lane**: Shown to continue straight or possibly turn right, not for 290E.  \n- (B) **Center lanes**: The middle lanes in the final frames do not have left turn arrows and would not access 290E.  \n- (C) **Left\u2010most lane**: The clearly designated left\u2010turn\u2010only lanes lead to 290 East, so the safe and sure choice is the leftmost lane.  \n- (D) **Any lane**: Incorrect; only the left\u2010turn lanes go to 290E.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
