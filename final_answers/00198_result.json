  "answer": "1) Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:\n\n\u2022 Frame 1: The ego vehicle is traveling along a two\u2010lane road in wet conditions. Traffic is moving in both directions, and vehicles are parked along the right curb. No clear sign of an intersection or traffic control device yet.  \n\u2022 Frame 2: As the ego continues, a white truck is parked on the right, obscuring some of the view. Still no obvious traffic light or stop sign in sight. However, just beyond the truck, there appears to be a traffic signal or signage at the roadside.  \n\u2022 Frame 3: A diamond\u2010shaped warning sign is visible on the right, showing a stop\u2010sign symbol with an upward arrow. This is a \u201cstop sign ahead\u201d warning sign.  \n\u2022 Frame 4: The same \u201cstop sign ahead\u201d warning sign is now more clearly in view at the right edge (orange diamond sign with a stop sign icon and arrow above it). The intersection with an actual stop sign is now visible in the distance (on the right corner).  \n\u2022 Frame 5: The stop sign ahead sign is even more apparent, and you can see the red stop sign at the corner on the right side of the intersection.\n\n2) Contextual Reasoning:  \nFrames 3 through 5 make it clear that this upcoming intersection is controlled by a stop sign (it\u2019s not merely a yield). Standard rules of the road dictate that one must come to a full stop at a stop\u2010controlled intersection.\n\n3) Match to Answer Choices:  \n\u2022 A (Continue at the same speed) would violate traffic law at a stop sign.  \n\u2022 B (Slow down but do not come to a stop) also violates stop\u2010sign rules.  \n\u2022 C (Come to a stop) aligns with the visible sign indicating a complete stop is required.  \n\u2022 D (Speed up) is unsafe and clearly incorrect.  \n\n4) Provide the Best Answer:  \nBecause there is a stop sign clearly indicated and visible (with a \u201cstop sign ahead\u201d warning sign confirming it), the correct behavior is to come to a full stop at the intersection.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
