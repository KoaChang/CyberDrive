  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1** \u2013 We see a single signal\u2010controlled intersection immediately ahead. The overhead mast arm has a left\u2010turn arrow signal on the far left and three solid lights across the lane(s) for through traffic. No second intersection signal is distinguishable farther down the road.  \n2. **Frames 2\u20135** \u2013 The same primary traffic signal remains in view (with some changing of the red/arrow indications), but no additional set of overhead lights controlling the straight path appears. Headlights and streetlights farther away do not appear to be additional traffic signals.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 All five frames consistently show only one intersection with a functioning traffic signal that would govern going straight.  \n\u2022 Although you can see lights in the distance, they do not appear to be traffic signals (more likely tail lamps or street lighting), so there is only one set of signals actually controlling the through movement.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) 1 \u2013 Consistent with the single intersection visible in all frames.  \n\u2022 (B) 2, (C) 3, (D) 4 \u2013 No evidence of multiple signalized intersections ahead for straight travel.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \nSince only one traffic light controls the driver\u2019s straight travel, the answer is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
