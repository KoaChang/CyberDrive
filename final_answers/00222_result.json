  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis:**\n\n1. **Frame 1** reveals three lanes.  The leftmost lane has a large curved\u2010left arrow painted on the pavement.  The camera (ego) appears centered in the middle lane.  Off to the right is a sign with two arrows\u2014one left and one right\u2014over the word \u201cONLY,\u201d but that sign applies to the two outer lanes (left lane must turn left, right lane must turn right).\n\n2. **Frames 2\u20133** show clearly that the marking in the ego\u2019s lane combines a left\u2010turn arrow with what (despite the camera\u2019s angle) is a largely \u201cstraight\u2010ahead\u201d arrow.  In other words, from the middle lane you may either turn left or go straight through the intersection.  The rightmost lane has its own right\u2010turn\u2010only arrow seen off to the side.\n\n3. **Frames 4\u20135** confirm the middle lane\u2019s combined arrow marking is for left or straight.  The signal heads overhead also indicate a dedicated left\u2010turn phase for the left lane and a separate right\u2010turn signal for the rightmost lane.  Nothing restricts the middle lane from continuing straight.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning:**\nPutting those markings and signs together, the lane under the ego vehicle is neither left\u2010only nor right\u2010only.  Instead, it is the lane that permits going straight through or turning left.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices:**\nA) Turn left only \u2192 contradicted by the straight\u2010ahead arrow.  \nB) Turn right only \u2192 contradicted by a visible left arrow (and the right\u2010turn lane is off to the side).  \nC) Turn left and go straight \u2192 matches the combined pavement markings in the ego lane.  \nD) Turn right and go straight \u2192 contradicted by the marking showing a left arrow rather than a right arrow.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
