  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The ego\u2010vehicle is approaching an intersection. The multi\u2010section signal head over the through lanes shows a green (circular) indication; a separate left\u2010turn signal head is not visibly lit at this moment. A sign overhead reads \u201cLEFT TURN YIELD ON FLASHING YELLOW ARROW.\u201d  \n2. **Frame 2**: The through\u2010lane signal above the ego\u2019s lane is still lit solid green. The left\u2010turn arrow (to the left of that signal) appears amber but is for the left\u2010turn lane only.  \n3. **Frame 3**: Main through signal continues to show a solid green circular lens for the ego. The left arrow to its left is still amber.  \n4. **Frame 4**: No change in the through\u2010lane light; it remains solid green for straight movement.  \n5. **Frame 5**: The overhead sign and left\u2010turn arrow remain for left\u2010turn traffic only, while the ego\u2019s solid green circular signal is unchanged.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nThroughout all frames, the traffic light that applies to the ego (traveling straight) is the solid green circular signal. The amber arrow shown in frames 2\u20135 is a separate indication for left\u2010turn traffic (\u201cflashing yellow arrow\u201d) and does **not** override or replace the solid green for through movement. Crucially, there is no evidence of flashing red or flashing yellow for the ego\u2019s lane, nor does the green appear to have changed to yellow.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 A (Flashing red): Not observed; the through signal is never red, let alone flashing red.  \n\u2022 B (Flashing yellow): The separate left\u2010turn arrow is flashing yellow, but that is for the turn lane\u2014not the ego\u2019s through lane.  \n\u2022 C (Solid green): Consistent across all frames for the ego\u2019s lane.  \n\u2022 D (Solid yellow): The through signal never becomes solid yellow for the ego.  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>  ",
