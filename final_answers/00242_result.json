  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1:** Five distinct parallel streams of vehicles are visible ahead. From left to right, there is a dark pickup in the leftmost lane, another vehicle in the second lane, the red SUV (ego\u2019s lane) in the middle, a white van in the fourth lane, and a car on the far right.  \n2. **Frame 2 and Frame 3:** The same overall five\u2010lane arrangement is clearer\u2014each lane has its own cluster of cars, with visible lane markings ahead of and behind the vehicles.  \n3. **Frame 4:** A white pickup appears in the leftmost lane, the dark pickup is in the second, the red SUV remains in the center lane, the white van is still to its right, and another sedan is on the far right, reinforcing that there are five lanes.  \n4. **Frame 5:** Again, you can pick out five columns of traffic side by side, matching the earlier pattern.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll frames consistently show five lanes moving in the same (ego\u2019s) direction. The far right lane abuts a concrete wall, and to the far left appears to be a managed/toll lane. No evidence suggests fewer or more than five active, drivable lanes going in this direction.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2010 A (2 lanes) and B (3 lanes) are clearly too few for a highway section with multiple parallel lanes visible.  \n\u2010 C (4 lanes) is still fewer than the five parallel streams plainly visible.  \n\u2010 D (5 lanes) aligns with the counts in all frames.  \n\n<answer>D</answer>  ",
