  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1 & 2:** We see a residential street leading to a T\u2010intersection up ahead. A large utility truck is stationed on the intersecting road with traffic cones arranged around it. There is a standard octagonal **STOP** sign facing the ego vehicle; no signage is visible restricting left or right turns.  \n2. **Frame 3:** The intersection design becomes clearer. A crosswalk is painted on the side road, and cones are placed around the truck. Still, no \u201cNo Left Turn,\u201d \u201cNo Right Turn,\u201d or any other prohibitive signage appears in view.  \n3. **Frame 4 & 5:** The closer views confirm a T\u2010intersection with a clear **STOP** marking on the pavement. There are traffic cones around the truck, but they do not appear to block either left or right turns. No \u201cOne Way\u201d or \u201cNo U\u2010turn\u201d signs are visible.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \n\u2022 At a typical T\u2010intersection with a STOP sign, and in the absence of any special signage (for example, \u201cNo Left Turn,\u201d \u201cNo Right Turn,\u201d or \u201cOne Way\u201d), the lawful actions from that stop line are to turn left or turn right.  \n\u2022 Cones and work vehicles do not appear to close off or prohibit either turning direction; rather, they constrain the shoulder area of the intersecting street.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. \u201cTurn left only\u201d would require specific \u201cNo Right Turn\u201d restrictions, which are not visible.  \nB. \u201cTurn right only\u201d would require a \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d or a one\u2010way sign; again, we have no indication of that.  \nC. \u201cTurn left and turn right\u201d is consistent with a standard T\u2010intersection that shows no restrictions.  \nD. \u201cU\u2010turn only\u201d is neither posted nor typical at such an intersection, and we see no signage mandating a U\u2010turn.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>",
