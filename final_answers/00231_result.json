  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n\u2022 **Frame 1 & 2:** You can see multiple overhead signs looming ahead but not yet clearly distinguishing which lane goes where. The concrete barrier on the far right, plus the large green signs, suggest upcoming splits for I\u2010395, Route 110, and Route 27. At this point, it\u2019s not obvious whether the lane the camera car is in will lead to Route 27.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 3:** The signage becomes clearer:  \n  \u2013 One sign points left (I\u2010395 South to Pentagon City, Crystal City, Alexandria).  \n  \u2013 Another indicates Route\u202f27 (Washington Blvd / S.\u202fAir\u202fRidge\u202fRd) over on the right.  \n  \u2013 A separate sign farther right points to Route\u202f110 North (to I\u201066 West / Rosslyn).\n\n\u2022 **Frame 4:** Now you can see that the two rightmost lanes each have separate \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d markings overhead\u2014one for Route\u202f27, one for Route\u202f110. The \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d panel for Route\u202f27 is *not* over the lane where the camera currently appears to be traveling; it is one lane to the right.\n\n\u2022 **Frame 5:** The overhead signs confirm that the second lane from the right is the dedicated exit for Route\u202f27 (labeled \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d for \u201cWashington Blvd / S. Air Ridge Rd\u201d), while the far right lane is \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d for Route\u202f110. The red car ahead is in the lane that continues straight, so to reach 27, you would need to move at least one lane to the right into that \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d lane under the \u201c27\u201d signage.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nBecause Route 27\u2019s overhead \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d sign is *not* over the camera car\u2019s current lane, simply staying put would miss the correct exit. The left lanes head to I\u2010395, and the far right lane serves Route\u202f110. Therefore, the only way to get onto 27 is to **change one lane to the right** and take that exit lane.\n\n**Matching to Answer Choices**\n\n\u2022 **A. Lane change to the left:** Incorrect; 27 is off to the right.  \n\u2022 **B. Stay on the current lane:** Incorrect; the current lane does not appear to exit to 27.  \n\u2022 **C. Lane change to the right:** Correct; that lane is marked \u201cEXIT ONLY\u201d for Rt\u202f27.  \n\u2022 **D. Insufficient information:** The overhead signage is clear enough, so this is not correct.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
