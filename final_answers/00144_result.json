  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**\n\n1. **Frame 1** shows the roadway beginning to fan out into three distinct lanes\u2014left, center, and right.  Although the pavement markings are somewhat distant, signs ahead suggest separate directions (the diamond \u201cEnd Freeway\u201d sign is off to the far left, but the more relevant directional signs are still a bit small).\n\n2. **Frame 2** more clearly shows three lanes with overhead signs depicting split arrows for each lane. None of these signs yet show which lane goes straight versus turns, but we see that the roadway is about to reach an intersection with at least three lanes.\n\n3. **Frame 3** provides a good look at the lane\u2010usage sign (just left of center).  It has three distinct arrows: a left\u2010turn arrow for the left lane, a straight\u2010through arrow for the center lane, and a right\u2010turn arrow for the right lane.  The pavement markings on the left lane and right lane also appear to curve, reinforcing that those are turn lanes, whereas the center lane points straight.\n\n4. **Frame 4** clarifies the pavement markings:  \n   - The left lane\u2019s large white arrow is curved left, indicating left\u2010turn only.  \n   - The center lane\u2019s arrow is a straight\u2010ahead arrow.  \n   - The right lane is labeled \u201cONLY\u201d with a large right\u2010turn arrow.\n\n5. **Frame 5** confirms that the right lane says \u201cONLY\u201d with an arrow curving to the right, and the left lane lines angle off separately for left turns.  The pickup truck ahead is in the (sole) through lane in the middle.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**\n\nAcross the last two frames (4 and 5), it becomes unmistakably clear that the left lane peels off left, the right lane peels off right, and only the middle lane continues straight.  This is also consistent with the triple\u2010arrow signs in Frames 2 and 3.\n\n**Matching to the Answer Choices**\n\n- A. **1** lane goes straight, with the other two lanes signed and marked for turns only.  \n- B, C, D are contradicted by the pavement arrows and \u201cONLY\u201d markings for left and right.\n\nHence the correct count is **1**.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
