  "answer": "**Frame\u2010by\u2010Frame Analysis**  \n1. **Frame 1**: The roadway is under construction on the right; there are orange barrels/cones and heavy equipment digging up the shoulder area.  \n2. **Frame 2**: Same stretch of road, with the right edge coned off for construction\u2014no clear or open shoulder.  \n3. **Frame 3**: Closer view of the construction machinery along the right\u2010hand side; the cones and dirt pile extend alongside the driving lane.  \n4. **Frame 4**: Still no safe, unobstructed space on the right; the cones and equipment continue and occupy what would ordinarily be a shoulder.  \n5. **Frame 5**: Cones and construction vehicles remain present on the right, making the would\u2010be shoulder inaccessible.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAcross all frames, the right side is consistently lined with cones and active excavation equipment. There is effectively no usable shoulder, as it is being used as a work zone.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n\u2022 (A) \u201cNo because of cones and roadwork.\u201d This matches the visual evidence: the right\u2010hand side is coned off, with machinery actively digging up the area.  \n\u2022 (B) \u201cNo because there is no shoulder.\u201d While the usual shoulder is effectively gone, the more direct cause shown is that the nominal shoulder area is being actively used/blocked by construction.  \n\u2022 (C) \u201cYes.\u201d The frames do not show a safe open shoulder to pull over on, so this is contradicted by the evidence.  \n\u2022 (D) \u201cNo because of parked cars.\u201d There are no cars parked along the right; the obstruction is roadwork, not parked vehicles.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \nBecause the roadway\u2019s right side is coned off and occupied by construction activities, the best choice is:  \n\n<answer>A</answer>",
