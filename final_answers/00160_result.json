  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1** shows a relatively narrow roadway with a double-yellow centerline. One vehicle is traveling ahead in the same direction as the dashcam (ego). No stripes on the right side separate an additional lane.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2** continues to show the double-yellow lines and the same apparent single file of vehicles ahead, still with no extra lane stripes on the right.  \n\u2022 **Frame 3** through **Frame 5** confirm that the road maintains a single lane in the ego direction, divided from oncoming traffic by the double-yellow lines. There is no visually indicated turning lane or extra through lane.\n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAll five frames depict the same two-lane roadway: one lane for the ego\u2019s direction, one lane for oncoming traffic. The presence of a solid double-yellow line indicates opposing lanes rather than two same-direction lanes.\n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \n- A. 1 lane in ego\u2019s direction \u2192 Matches the consistent single lane in the video.  \n- B. 2 lanes in ego\u2019s direction \u2192 Not supported by the images; there is no second designated same-direction lane.  \n- C. 3 lanes or D. 4 lanes \u2192 Not possible given the narrow roadway and the single corridor for opposite-direction traffic.\n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>A</answer>  ",
