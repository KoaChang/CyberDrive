  "answer": "**Frame-by-Frame Analysis**  \n\u2022 **Frame 1:** On the right\u2010hand side, there is a circular sign with a red slash over two arrows. One arrow points to the left, and the other is a U\u2010turn arrow.  \n\u2022 **Frame 2 & Frame 3:** The sign is still visible, and the same two arrows\u2014left\u2010turn and U\u2010turn\u2014are clearly shown under the prohibitive symbol.  \n\u2022 **Frame 4 & Frame 5:** The sign remains the same; no additional markings or text are visible.  \n\n**Contextual Reasoning**  \nAlthough the sign has two arrows (one for a left turn and one for a U\u2010turn), both are covered by the same red circle and slash. This means that both of these movements\u2014turning left or making a U\u2010turn\u2014are prohibited in this area.  \n\n**Match to Answer Choices**  \nA. \u201cNo left turn\u201d would only prohibit turning left, but the sign clearly also indicates no U\u2010turn.  \nB. \u201cNo U\u2010turn\u201d alone likewise misses the left\u2010turn prohibition.  \nC. \u201cNo left turn or U\u2010turn\u201d fits the observed sign perfectly.  \nD. \u201cNo right turn\u201d conflicts with what is shown (the sign does not show a right\u2010turn arrow).  \n\n**Provide the Best Answer**  \n<answer>C</answer>  ",
