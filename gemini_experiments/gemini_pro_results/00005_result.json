  "answer": "Let's analyze the frames to determine the oncoming car's blinker state.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The oncoming car's headlights are visible. It's hard to discern any blinker activity.\n*   **Frame 2:** The oncoming car is closer. Still no clear indication of a blinker.\n*   **Frame 3:** The oncoming car is even closer. No definitive blinker.\n*   **Frame 4:** The oncoming car is very close. The headlights are clearly visible, but there's no sign of a flashing blinker on either side.\n*    **Frame 5:** The oncoming car is the closest. It is clear that the left headlight, from the oncoming car's perspective, is off, while the right one is on.\n\nBased on the progression, and especially the clear view in Frame 5, the left headlight is not working, which means the blinker is off.\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n",
