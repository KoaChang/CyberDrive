  "answer": "*   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the left lane, approaching an intersection. There's a right-turn-only lane, but it's blocked by construction.\n*   **Frame 2:** Ego continues in the left lane. The construction in the right-turn lane is still clearly visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** Ego starts to move slightly towards the right, but there are cars stopped in the left lane ahead, waiting at the traffic light.\n*   **Frame 4:** Ego continues moving right, getting closer to the stopped traffic in the left lane.\n*   **Frame 5:** Ego is almost fully alongside the stopped cars, effectively blocking part of the left lane while trying to squeeze into the right-turn area, which is still blocked by construction.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n*   Option A is incorrect. While the lane ego is moving into might appear momentarily empty in some frames, it's not a legal lane to use for turning right.\n*   Option B is partially correct. The right turn lane is blocked.\n*   Option C is the most accurate. Ego is cutting in front of vehicles that are waiting in the left lane to go straight or turn left. This is generally illegal.\n*   Option D is incorrect. The width of the lane is not the primary issue; it's the illegal maneuver of cutting in line.\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n",
