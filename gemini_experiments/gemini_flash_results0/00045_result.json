  "answer": "Following the steps:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n    *   **Frame 1:**  Two lanes are visible, separated by dashed white lines. Double yellow lines are on the left side, indicating the opposite direction of traffic. A \"Greer Road\" sign is visible. Traffic signals are ahead, showing red lights. No immediate signs of lane blockage are apparent, but we see traffic stopped at the red light.\n    *   **Frame 2:**  Similar to Frame 1, the road layout is the same. Traffic signals are still red. We can start to notice some orange cones in the distance on the right side of the road, but it's not yet clear if they are blocking a lane.\n    *   **Frame 3:**  Getting closer to the traffic signals and the orange cones. The cones are now more clearly visible on the right side of the road. It appears they are positioned within the rightmost lane. Vehicles are present in the left lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:**  The orange cones are now very prominent in the rightmost lane. We can see construction workers near the cones. Vehicles are clearly using the left lane to navigate around the construction zone. The right lane is visibly blocked by the cones and workers.\n    *   **Frame 5:**  Close-up view of the construction area. The rightmost lane is definitively blocked by orange cones and construction workers. Vehicles are still using the left lane to proceed.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n    As we progress through the frames, we are moving forward and approaching a construction zone. The orange cones and construction workers consistently appear in the rightmost lane. The presence of vehicles using the left lane to bypass the construction further confirms that the rightmost lane is blocked. The traffic signals being red in the initial frames suggest that traffic might be stopped due to the construction ahead.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Left most lane:**  The construction is clearly on the right side of the road in the direction of travel, not the left. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Center lane:**  The road appears to have two lanes in the direction of travel, a left lane and a right lane. There isn't a \"center lane\" in the typical sense for a two-lane road in one direction.  This option is likely incorrect in this context.\n    *   **C. Right most lane:**  The visual evidence strongly indicates that the rightmost lane is blocked by construction cones and workers. This option aligns perfectly with our observations.\n    *   **D. None of the above:** Since option C appears to be correct, this option is likely incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n    Based on the frame-by-frame analysis and contextual reasoning, the rightmost lane is blocked by construction.\n\n**Final Answer:** <answer>C. Right most lane.</answer>",
