  "answer": "Following the steps:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n    *   **Frame 1:**  A grey truck is visible in the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle. The road appears to be a multi-lane highway with white lane markings. Other vehicles are present in adjacent lanes. The truck's brake lights are illuminated. It's difficult to definitively see blinkers from this frame alone, but the question implies they are on.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The truck is closer, still in the right lane. Brake lights remain on. No significant changes in road context. Still hard to confirm blinkers definitively.\n    *   **Frame 3:**  Truck is even closer. Brake lights are still on. Road markings and other vehicles remain consistent.  Blinkers still not clearly visible as blinking from a static image.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The truck is quite close now. Brake lights are still on. Upon closer inspection (especially using the provided crops), a faint orange glow can be observed from the right rear light of the truck. This suggests the right blinker is indeed active.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Very close to the truck. Brake lights are still on. The right blinker is more clearly visible now in the crops, confirming it is active.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n    *   The truck is in the right lane and appears to be slowing down (brake lights are on in all frames).\n    *   The right blinker is confirmed to be on from Frame 4 and 5.\n    *   The road is a multi-lane highway, possibly on a bridge or elevated road given the railings.\n    *   There are no visible signs of lane merging or lane changing markings on the road immediately around the truck.\n    *   The truck is not positioned to make a right turn at an intersection as there is no visible intersection in the frames.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. To signal a lane change away from ego.**  A lane change \"away from ego\" in this context would mean a lane change to the right. However, the truck is already in the rightmost lane. There is no lane to the right to change into. This option is unlikely.\n    *   **B. To signal a merge towards ego.** A \"merge towards ego\" would mean a lane change to the left, into the ego vehicle's lane. If the truck were merging left, it should be using its *left* blinker, not the right one. This option is also unlikely.\n    *   **C. To show hazardous conditions.** Hazard lights (both left and right blinkers) are often used to indicate hazardous conditions such as a breakdown, accident, or unexpected traffic slowdown. While we only clearly see the right blinker, it's possible that in some contexts, a single blinker or hazard lights are used to indicate caution or pulling over due to a perceived hazard. Given the brake lights are on and the truck is slowing down, this is a plausible reason.\n    *   **D. Its blinkers are not on.**  This is directly contradicted by the observation in Frames 4 and 5 where the right blinker is visibly glowing orange. This option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n    Based on the analysis, option C, \"To show hazardous conditions,\" is the most plausible explanation. While ideally hazard lights (both blinkers) would be used for hazardous conditions, it's possible the driver is using the right blinker to signal caution or is pulling over to the right side of the road due to a perceived hazard ahead, even if not immediately visible in the frames. Options A, B, and D are less likely or directly contradicted by the visual evidence.\n\n<answer>C. To show hazardous conditions.</answer>",
