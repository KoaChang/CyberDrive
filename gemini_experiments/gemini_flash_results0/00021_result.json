  "answer": "Following the steps:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is driving on a road with double yellow lines to its left. To the right, there is a lane separated by a solid white line and white bollards. Further to the right, there's a curb and yellow bollards. The lane to the right of ego has dashed white lines within it. A sign is visible on the right side of the road, appearing to be a 'T' intersection sign. Another sign is visible further down the road, but it's not clearly readable.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, the lane to the right is separated by a solid white line and bollards. The 'T' intersection sign is more visible. The second sign down the road is also more visible but still not clearly readable.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The road curves slightly to the right. The lane to the right of ego maintains the solid white line and bollard separation. The second sign down the road is still not clearly readable, but it seems to have symbols on it.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The curve becomes more pronounced. The lane markings on the right are clearer - dashed white lines within the lane. The second sign is now slightly more readable and appears to have a bicycle symbol on it.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The curve is even more pronounced. The lane to the right is clearly marked with dashed white lines and bollards. The second sign is now reasonably clear and shows a bicycle symbol above a pedestrian symbol, with a 'yield' symbol above them.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The double yellow lines to the left of ego indicate a no-passing zone and that ego is in a standard travel lane.\n    *   The lane to the right is physically separated from the ego lane by a solid white line and bollards, suggesting it's a special type of lane.\n    *   The dashed white lines within the right lane indicate it's designed for movement in the same direction as ego.\n    *   The crucial element is the sign that becomes clearer in Frames 4 and 5. The bicycle symbol on the sign strongly suggests the lane is intended for bicycle traffic. The pedestrian symbol further suggests it might be a shared lane for bikes and pedestrians.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Bus lane:** Bus lanes are typically wider and often marked with \"BUS LANE\" signage or red paint. There is no such indication in the frames.\n    *   **B. Bike lane:** The presence of the bicycle symbol on the sign, along with the lane markings (solid white line, bollards, dashed white lines within), strongly supports this option. Bike lanes are often separated from car traffic for safety.\n    *   **C. Carpool lane:** Carpool lanes are usually marked with diamond symbols and are not typically physically separated by bollards. They are also usually adjacent to regular traffic lanes without a solid white line and bollard separation.\n    *   **D. Right-turn-only lane:** Right-turn-only lanes are usually found at intersections and are marked with curved arrows indicating a mandatory right turn. This lane appears to be continuous and straight, not leading to an immediate right turn.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the visual evidence, especially the bicycle symbol on the sign and the lane's physical separation and markings, the most appropriate answer is **B. Bike lane**.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
