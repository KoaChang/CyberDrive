  "answer": "Following the steps:\n\n**1. Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:**  We are driving on a multi-lane road (at least 3 lanes in our direction). Lane markings are dashed white lines separating lanes and a solid white line on the right edge.  Traffic signal ahead is green. A sign is visible on the right side of the road, but it's too far to read clearly.\n*   **Frame 2:**  Approaching the intersection. The sign on the right is becoming more visible. It appears to be a regulatory sign with an arrow. Traffic signal is still green.\n*   **Frame 3:** The sign on the right is now clearly readable: \"RIGHT LANE  -> ONLY\" with a right-pointing arrow. This is a lane usage control sign. Traffic signal is still green.\n*   **Frame 4:** The \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" sign is very prominent and clear.  The lane markings are consistent. Traffic signal is still green.\n*   **Frame 5:**  We are very close to the intersection. The \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" sign is still visible, confirming the restriction for the rightmost lane. Lane markings are still consistent.\n\n**2. Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe most crucial element is the regulatory sign \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" with a right arrow. This sign is designed to inform drivers in the rightmost lane that they are required to turn right at the upcoming intersection.  The lane markings (solid white line on the right) are typical for rightmost lanes that are designated for right turns. The green traffic signal indicates that traffic flow is permitted in the forward direction, but the lane-specific sign overrides any general assumption about going straight from this lane.\n\n**3. Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Go straight only.** - This option is directly contradicted by the \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" sign.\n*   **B. Turn right only.** - This option is perfectly aligned with the \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" sign and the right-pointing arrow.\n*   **C. Go straight and turn right.** - This option is also contradicted by the \"ONLY\" word on the sign, which restricts the maneuver to a right turn only.\n*   **D. None of the above.** - Since option B is a valid and directly supported answer, this option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Provide the Best Answer:**\n\nBased on the clear and consistent signage observed in the frames, especially the \"RIGHT LANE ONLY\" sign, the available maneuver for the rightmost lane is to turn right only.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<answer>B. Turn right only.</answer>",
