  "answer": "Following the steps:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n    *   **Frame 1:** Approaching an intersection at night. Road markings include double yellow lines. Signage visible on the right side of the road includes a yellow roundabout warning sign (circular arrows), a yellow speed limit sign (20 MPH), and a yellow pedestrian crossing sign. A green street sign is also visible further ahead but text is unclear.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Closer to the intersection. The roundabout sign and speed limit sign are clearer. Highway signs for I-75 South and I-85 are now visible above the roundabout sign. The green street sign is still not fully legible.\n    *   **Frame 3:**  Even closer. The green street sign becomes legible: \"Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\" with a right-pointing arrow. Highway signs are clearer. Road markings for entering a roundabout are becoming more apparent with dashed lines curving to the right.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Entering the roundabout. The \"Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\" sign is now very clear, with the right arrow prominent. Road markings clearly indicate the roundabout entrance.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Inside the roundabout. The \"Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\" sign is now to the right and slightly behind the driver's perspective. The road ahead curves to the left, consistent with navigating a roundabout in a clockwise direction (in countries where driving is on the right).\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n    The sequence of frames shows the vehicle approaching and entering a roundabout. The key piece of information is the green street sign that becomes clearly visible in Frame 3, 4, and 5. This sign explicitly states \"Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\" with an arrow pointing to the right. This indicates that taking the right exit at the roundabout will lead to Monroe Drive.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Straight:**  In a roundabout, going \"straight\" would typically be the second exit. The sign clearly directs to the right for Monroe Drive, so \"straight\" is unlikely.\n    *   **B. Left:** Taking a \"left\" in a roundabout (in a right-hand drive country) would be a later exit, typically the third exit. Again, the sign points right for Monroe Drive, making \"left\" unlikely.\n    *   **C. Right:** The sign explicitly points to the right for \"Monroe Drive\". In a roundabout, the first exit is to the right. This option directly aligns with the signage observed in the frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n    Based on the clear signage indicating \"Monroe Drive\" with a right arrow at the roundabout, the correct answer is **Right**.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
