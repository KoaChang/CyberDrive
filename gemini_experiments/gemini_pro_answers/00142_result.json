  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** We are in the right lane, approaching an intersection. Double yellow lines separate us from oncoming traffic. The traffic light is green. There is a car in front of us.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The car ahead is still in front. The traffic light remains green.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The car ahead begins to slow down. The traffic light is still green.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The car ahead is almost stopped. The traffic light is still green.\n    *   **Frame 5:** We are closer to the intersection. The traffic light is green. Above and to the right of the solid green light, there is a right turn arrow, also green. Above the solid green light, there is a sign that says \"One Way\" with an arrow pointing to the right.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most crucial frames are Frame 1 and Frame 5. Frame 1 shows the initial approach, and Frame 5 provides the clearest view of the intersection's signage and traffic signals.\n    *   The \"One Way\" sign with a right-pointing arrow in Frame 5 is the most important piece of information. It indicates that the cross street at the intersection is a one-way street, and traffic flows only to the right.\n    *   The green light indicates it is permissible to proceed straight or turn right.\n    *   There is no left turn signal.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. No it's a one way going right.** This aligns perfectly with the \"One Way\" sign pointing right.\n    *   **B. No we have to wait for left turn signal.** There is no left-turn signal, and the one-way sign makes a left turn illegal.\n    *   **C. No there is oncoming traffic.** While there *is* oncoming traffic in our direction of travel, this isn't relevant to the legality of a *left* turn at the upcoming intersection. The question is about turning left *into* the cross street, not about proceeding straight.\n    *   **D. Yes it is legal and safe.** This is incorrect due to the one-way sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best answer is A because the one-way sign pointing to the right clearly indicates that turning left is illegal.\n\n    <answer>A</answer>\n"
