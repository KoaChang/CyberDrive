  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Ego is in a lane with double yellow lines to the left, and a solid white line to the right, followed by a dashed white line, and then a solid white line again, with vertical white delineators separating this lane from the curb. There is a yellow sign with a right-turn arrow and a T-intersection symbol.\n*   **Frame 2:** The lane markings and signage are the same as in Frame 1.\n*   **Frame 3:** The lane markings and signage are the same as in Frame 1.\n*   **Frame 4:** The dashed white line to the right of ego becomes solid.\n*   **Frame 5:** The dashed white line to the right of ego is solid.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The consistent solid and dashed white lines, along with the vertical delineators, to the right of the ego vehicle, strongly suggest a separate lane that is not for general traffic.\n*   The yellow sign with a right-turn arrow and T-intersection symbol indicates an upcoming intersection where a right turn is possible.\n*   The lane to the right is separated by delineators, which are commonly used for bike lanes.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Bus lane:** Bus lanes are usually marked with \"BUS\" text on the pavement and are wider. There's no such marking here.\n*   **B. Bike lane:** Bike lanes are often separated by delineators or a buffer zone, and the width of the lane in the images is consistent with a bike lane.\n*   **C. Carpool lane:** Carpool lanes are typically marked with a diamond symbol and are on the left side of the road, not the right.\n*   **D. Right-turn-only lane:** While there's a right-turn sign, the lane itself is separated by delineators, which is not typical for a right-turn-only lane. Right-turn-only lanes usually begin with a dashed white line that becomes solid, but they are not separated from the adjacent lane by delineators.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
