  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The truck is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The truck's right blinker is on. There is a solid white line between the truck and the lane to its right.\n*   **Frame 2:** The truck is still ahead and to the right, with its right blinker on. The solid white line persists.\n*   **Frame 3:** The truck remains in the same position, right blinker still active. The solid white line is still present.\n*   **Frame 4:** The truck's position and right blinker status are unchanged. The solid white line continues.\n*   **Frame 5:** The truck is still ahead and to the right, right blinker on, and the solid white line is still there.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The truck's right blinker is consistently on in all frames.\n*   The truck is in the right lane, and there's a solid white line to its right, indicating the edge of the roadway or a shoulder, not a lane for regular travel.\n*   The truck does not change lanes.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. To signal a lane change away from ego:** Incorrect. The truck is already to the right of the ego vehicle and does not change lanes. The solid white line indicates it cannot move further right.\n*   **B. To signal a merge towards ego:** Incorrect. The truck's *right* blinker is on, not its left.\n*   **C. To show hazardous conditions:** This is the most plausible option. Given that the truck cannot change lanes to the right due to the solid white line, and its right blinker is consistently on, it's likely indicating a hazard.\n*   **D. Its blinkers are not on:** Incorrect. The images clearly show the truck's right blinker is active in all frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
