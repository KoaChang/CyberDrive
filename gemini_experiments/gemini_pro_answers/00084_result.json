  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in the right-most lane of a multi-lane highway. There's a large truck ahead. Overhead signs are visible but not yet fully legible. There is a solid white line to the right, and a dashed white line to the left.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The truck remains ahead. The overhead signs are becoming clearer.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The overhead signs are now readable. One sign indicates \"University Blvd\" with a right arrow.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The signs are very clear. \"University Blvd\" is clearly marked with a right arrow.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is passing under the signs. The \"University Blvd\" sign with the right arrow is directly overhead.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames show a progression along a highway.\n    *   The critical information is revealed in Frames 3, 4, and 5: the overhead sign clearly indicates that University Blvd is a *right* exit.\n    *   The ego vehicle is and remains in the right-most lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Continue lane changing to the left and keep right at the fork.** This is incorrect. The sign clearly indicates a right exit, and the ego vehicle is already in the right lane. Moving left would take the vehicle *away* from the correct exit.\n    *   **B. Continue straight and keep left at the fork.** This is incorrect. The sign indicates a right exit, not a left fork.\n    *   **C. Turn around.** This is incorrect. There's no indication that the ego vehicle has missed its exit or needs to turn around.\n    *   **D. None of the above.** This is the correct answer. The ego vehicle is already in the correct lane to take the right exit.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
