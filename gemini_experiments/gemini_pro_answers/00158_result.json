  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in the right-most lane. There's a \"No Left Turn\" sign visible on the left side of the road. Traffic lights are green. A street sign reads \"Congress\". There is a car to the right of the ego vehicle.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1, except a pedestrian is now crossing the street to the left.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The ego vehicle remains in the same lane throughout all frames.\n    *   The \"No Left Turn\" sign consistently indicates that a left turn is prohibited from *some* lane. Since the ego vehicle is in the right-most lane, and there is a car to its right, the no-left turn sign must apply to the lane to the left of the ego vehicle.\n    *   The traffic lights are green, indicating that forward movement is permitted.\n    *   There are no signs or road markings to suggest a right turn is prohibited.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Go straight:** This is possible, as the light is green.\n    *   **B. Turn left:** This is likely prohibited for the lane to the left of the ego vehicle, but not necessarily for the ego vehicle. However, given the position of the ego vehicle in the right-most lane, and the car to its right, a left turn would be unsafe and likely illegal.\n    *   **C. Turn right:** This is possible. There are no visible restrictions.\n    *   **D. Go straight, turn left and turn right:** Incorrect, because a left turn is likely prohibited and unsafe from the ego vehicle's position.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\nConsidering the green light, the lane position, and the absence of any right-turn restrictions, the most logical and safe maneuvers are to go straight or turn right.\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
