  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There's a crosswalk sign visible on the right. Cars are parked along the right side of the road. The traffic light is not yet clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The crosswalk sign is more prominent. A bike lane is marked on the right. The traffic light appears to be green.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. The crosswalk is now clearly visible, but no pedestrians are present.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The crosswalk is very close. A \"STOP HERE ON RED\" sign is visible above the traffic lights. Still no pedestrians.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is entering the crosswalk. No pedestrians are in or approaching the crosswalk.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The primary concern at a crosswalk is pedestrian safety.\n    *   The frames show a clear progression towards and into the crosswalk.\n    *   Crucially, *no pedestrians are ever seen* in or near the crosswalk in any of the frames.\n    *   The traffic light is green, indicating that vehicles have the right of way.\n    *   The \"STOP HERE ON RED\" sign reinforces that stopping is only required when the light is red.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. come to a stop:** This is incorrect. The light is green, and there are no pedestrians.\n    *   **B. wait for pedestrians to arrive:** This is incorrect. There's no requirement to wait for pedestrians to *potentially* arrive. You only yield to pedestrians who are present.\n    *   **C. pullover:** This is incorrect. Pulling over is not relevant to a crosswalk scenario with a green light and no pedestrians.\n    *   **D. proceed without stopping:** This is the correct action. With a green light and no pedestrians present, the driver should proceed through the crosswalk.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
