  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection with a red light. There's a sign on the right with directional arrows, indicating the right lane is for right turns only. The ego vehicle is not in the right lane. There are two lanes visible.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. Road markings are becoming visible. An arrow pointing straight and an arrow pointing to the left are visible in the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The road markings are very clear. The ego vehicle's lane has a straight arrow and a left-turn arrow.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The traffic light remains red. The road markings are still visible, but the car is moving closer to the crosswalk.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The car is even closer to the stop line. The road markings are still visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are Frame 2 and Frame 3, where the road markings in the ego vehicle's lane are clearly visible.\n    *   The sign in Frame 1 is relevant to the right-most lane, but not the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   The road markings in the ego vehicle's lane indicate that the driver can either go straight or turn left.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Turn left only:** Incorrect. The road markings show a straight arrow as well.\n    *   **B. Turn right only:** Incorrect. The road markings and the sign in Frame 1 do not indicate this for the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   **C. Turn left and go straight:** Correct. This aligns with the road markings in Frames 2 and 3.\n    *   **D. Turn right and go straight:** Incorrect. There is no right-turn arrow in the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
