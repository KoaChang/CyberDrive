  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A car is visible in front of the ego vehicle, under an overpass. It's night, and the road is wet. The car's brake lights are illuminated. No turn signals are apparent.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, the car in front has brake lights on. No turn signals are visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** The car in front continues to show brake lights. No turn signals are visible.\n*   **Frame 4:** The car in front still has brake lights on. No turn signals are visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** The car in front is now further away. The brake lights are no longer illuminated, and no turn signals are visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The car in front is consistently braking through frames 1-4.\n*   There is no indication of any turn signal (left or right) or hazard lights in any of the frames.\n*   In frame 5, the brake lights are off, and no other lights are on.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Right signal light on:** No right signal is observed in any frame.\n*   **B. Left signal light on:** No left signal is observed in any frame.\n*   **C. Blinkers are off:** This aligns with the observations, especially in Frame 5 where the brake lights are also off.\n*   **D. Hazard lights are on:** No hazard lights (which would involve both left and right indicators flashing) are observed.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
