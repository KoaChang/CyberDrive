  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road has multiple lanes. The ego vehicle is in the rightmost lane. There are signs indicating left turns and a sign with a right turn arrow. There are also traffic lights ahead. The lane to the left of the ego vehicle has \"ONLY\" painted on it.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The \"ONLY\" marking is now clearly visible in the lane to the left of the ego vehicle. A right turn arrow sign is also visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** A right-turn arrow is painted on the road in the ego vehicle's current lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to Frame 3, the right-turn arrow is still visible, but the car is closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is very close to the intersection. The right-turn arrow is still visible. The lane to the left has a left-turn arrow.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are Frame 3, Frame 4, and Frame 5, as they clearly show a right-turn arrow painted on the road within the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   Frames 1 and 2 provide context, showing the approach to the intersection and the presence of other lanes, but Frame 3 is definitive for the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   The \"ONLY\" marking in the adjacent lane in Frames 1, 2, 4, and 5, combined with the left-turn arrow in Frame 5, indicates that the adjacent lane is exclusively for left turns.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Go straight only:** Incorrect. The right-turn arrow in the lane contradicts this.\n    *   **B. Turn left only:** Incorrect. The ego vehicle is not in the left-turn lane, and the arrow indicates a right turn.\n    *   **C. Turn right only:** Correct. The right-turn arrow painted on the road in the ego vehicle's lane clearly indicates this is the only permitted maneuver.\n    *   **D. U-turn only:** Incorrect. There's no indication of a U-turn being permitted or even possible.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
