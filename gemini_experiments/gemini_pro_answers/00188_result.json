  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There are multiple lanes, and the traffic light is yellow. A \"No Right Turn\" sign is visible on the right.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, the ego vehicle is still approaching the intersection. The \"No Right Turn\" sign is more clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. The traffic light is now red. A left-turn arrow is visible on the road surface in the lane to the left of the ego vehicle.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is even closer, and the crosswalk is now visible. The left-turn arrow in the adjacent lane is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is at the intersection. The road markings in the ego vehicle's lane are not clearly visible, but the left-turn arrow in the adjacent lane is.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about the valid maneuvers for the *ego vehicle's current lane*.\n    *   The \"No Right Turn\" sign eliminates the possibility of a right turn.\n    *   The left-turn arrow in the *adjacent* lane indicates that the lane to the left is a left-turn-only lane.\n    *   There are no visible road markings *within* the ego vehicle's lane to restrict it to a left turn only.\n    *   The traffic light sequence (yellow to red) indicates the vehicle is approaching and stopping at the intersection.\n    *   Since there are no markings to indicate that the ego's lane is left-turn only, and the lane to its left is explicitly marked as left-turn only, it is reasonable to infer that the ego's lane is for going straight.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Straight only:** This aligns with the reasoning above.\n    *   **B. Left turn only:** This is incorrect, as there are no markings in the ego's lane to indicate this.\n    *   **C. Left turn and straight:** This is incorrect, as the lane to the left is explicitly for left turns only. If the ego's lane allowed for left turns, it would likely have a similar marking.\n    *   **D. Right turn only:** This is incorrect, as there is a \"No Right Turn\" sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
