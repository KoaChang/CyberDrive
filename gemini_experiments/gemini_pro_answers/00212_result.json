  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is approaching an intersection. There's a \"No Left Turn\" sign visible on the left. A green traffic signal is visible ahead. The lane markings are somewhat obscured, but a bike lane is to the left, separated by bollards.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The \"No Left Turn\" sign is clearer. The bike lane and bollards are more prominent. A bicyclist is visible in the bike lane.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2, but the car is closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The bicyclist is now more clearly in the bike lane, next to the bollards.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Ego vehicle is entering the intersection. The bicyclist is crossing the intersection in the bike lane.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The \"No Left Turn\" sign is consistently visible across all frames, indicating a left turn is prohibited for all lanes at this intersection.\n    *   The green traffic signal is also consistently visible, indicating that forward movement is permitted.\n    *   The bike lane and bollards are consistently present to the left of the ego vehicle.\n    *   A bicyclist is present in the bike lane, not in the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Ego is not allowed to turn left at this intersection.** This is supported by the \"No Left Turn\" sign visible in all frames.\n    *   **B. There are bicyclists in ego's lane.** This is FALSE. The bicyclist is consistently shown within the designated bike lane, separated by bollards.\n    *   **C. There are bollards to ego's left.** This is supported by the presence of bollards separating the bike lane from the ego vehicle's lane in all frames.\n    *   **D. Ego's lane has a green light.** This is supported by the green traffic signal visible in all frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The statement that is NOT true is B.\n\n    <answer>B</answer>\n"
