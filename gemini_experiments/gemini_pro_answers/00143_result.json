  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is approaching an intersection. There are two traffic lights visible. The left one has a red left-turn arrow, and the right one has a red light. There are multiple lanes, and crosswalk markings are visible.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Identical to Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The right traffic light has turned green. The left traffic light still shows a red left-turn arrow.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Identical to Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Identical to Frame 3 and 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows the ego vehicle approaching and stopping at an intersection.\n    *   The critical observation is the presence of two distinct traffic lights: one with a left-turn arrow and one without. The left-turn arrow remains red throughout all frames. The other light changes from red to green.\n    *   Because the left turn arrow is consistently red, and the ego is in the left lane, it is reasonable to assume that the left lane is a turn only lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. The light for traffic going straight is red.** This is incorrect. Frames 3, 4, and 5 show the light for going straight is green.\n    *   **B. The lane that ego is on is a turn only lane.** This is the most likely answer. The consistently red left-turn arrow, combined with the ego vehicle's position in the leftmost lane, strongly suggests this.\n    *   **C. The road ahead is blocked by construction.** There's no visual evidence of construction in any of the frames.\n    *   **D. The road ahead is blocked by a car.** There are other cars visible, but none are blocking the road ahead in a way that would prevent the ego vehicle from proceeding straight if it were allowed.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
