  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is behind a dark-colored SUV. It's nighttime. There are two lanes, separated by a double yellow line. There is a yellow sign on the right. The SUV's brake lights are on. No turn signals are visible.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Very similar to Frame 1. The SUV's brake lights are still on. No turn signals are visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Very similar to Frame 2. The SUV's brake lights are still on. No turn signals are visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Very similar to Frame 3. The SUV's brake lights are still on. No turn signals are visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The SUV's brake lights are still on. No turn signals are visible. A pickup truck is passing on the left.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about the blinker state of the car *in the same lane* as the ego vehicle *towards the end of the video*. Frames 4 and 5 are therefore most important.\n    *   The SUV in front is consistently braking, indicated by the illuminated brake lights.\n    *   At no point in any of the frames are any turn signals (left, right, or hazards) visible on the SUV.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. No blinker is on.** This aligns with the observations.\n    *   **B. Left blinker is on.** No left blinker is seen in any frame.\n    *   **C. Right blinker is on.** No right blinker is seen in any frame.\n    *   **D. Hazard lights are on.** No hazard lights are seen in any frame.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
