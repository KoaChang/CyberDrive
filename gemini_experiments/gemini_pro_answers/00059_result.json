  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is behind a black vehicle. There are two lanes, separated by double yellow lines. The traffic light is green. There are multiple cars ahead.\n*   **Frame 2:** The scene is very similar to Frame 1. The black vehicle remains directly in front. The traffic light is still green.\n*   **Frame 3:** The scene is very similar to Frame 2.\n*   **Frame 4:** The scene is very similar to Frame 3.\n*   **Frame 5:** The black vehicle has its left turn signal on. The traffic light is still green.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The black vehicle is in front of the ego vehicle.\n*   The black vehicle is in the left lane.\n*   The traffic light is green in all frames.\n*   In Frame 5, the black vehicle's left turn signal is activated.\n*   Since the traffic light is green and there is no separate left-turn signal visible, any left turn would be made while oncoming traffic also has a green light.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. An unprotected left turn:** This aligns with the observations. A green light without a dedicated left-turn arrow means the turn is unprotected, and the driver must yield to oncoming traffic.\n*   **B. A protected left turn:** This is incorrect. There's no indication of a dedicated left-turn signal (green arrow). The light is a solid green.\n*   **C. Driving straight:** This is incorrect. The left turn signal is on in Frame 5.\n*   **D. A right turn:** This is incorrect. The left turn signal is on, not the right.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
