  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The dashcam vehicle is approaching an intersection. There are solid white lines separating the lanes. The lane to the immediate right of the dashcam vehicle has a right-turn arrow. There is a pickup truck in that lane. There are traffic lights, and street signs indicating the cross street is \"Jupiter\".\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The right lane is clearly marked with a right-turn arrow.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 1 and 2. The right-turn arrow is very visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to previous frames.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to previous frames.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames consistently show a single lane to the right of the dashcam vehicle, marked with a right-turn arrow.\n    *   There are no other lanes to the right of that lane.\n    *   The question asks for the *number* of right-turn lanes.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This aligns with the observation of a single right-turn lane.\n    *   **B. 2:** There's no visual evidence of a second right-turn lane.\n    *   **C. 3:** There's no visual evidence of a third right-turn lane.\n    *   **D. 4:** There's no visual evidence of a fourth right-turn lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
