  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the right lane. There are two lanes. A \"Road Work Ahead\" sign is visible on the right shoulder, and a flashing arrow sign is visible further ahead, though the direction is not yet clear.\n*   **Frame 2:** The flashing arrow sign is still not clear.\n*   **Frame 3:** The flashing arrow sign is still not clear.\n*   **Frame 4:** The flashing arrow sign is still not clear.\n*   **Frame 5:** A sign that says \"One Lane Closed Ahead\" is visible. The flashing sign is now clearly pointing to the left.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The \"Road Work Ahead\" sign in earlier frames, combined with the \"One Lane Closed Ahead\" sign in Frame 5, indicates an upcoming lane closure.\n*   The flashing arrow, clearly visible in Frame 5, points left. This indicates that the *right* lane is closing, and traffic must merge left.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Stop ahead:** There's no indication of a required stop. The signs indicate a lane closure, not a full stop.\n*   **B. Right lane change ahead:** The arrow points left, not right.\n*   **C. No action required:** This is incorrect, as the lane closure requires a merge.\n*   **D. Left lane change ahead:** This aligns with the left-pointing arrow and the \"One Lane Closed Ahead\" sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
