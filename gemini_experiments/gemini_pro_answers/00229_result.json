  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A large tanker truck (\"WORLD OIL\") is to the left. Cars are ahead, and there's a green traffic light. A sign that says \"NARROW LANES\" is on the right.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, but closer to the intersection.\n*   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2. A \"ONE WAY\" sign is visible, with an arrow pointing to the left.\n*   **Frame 4:** Similar to Frame 3. The \"ONE WAY\" sign is very clear.\n*   **Frame 5:** Similar to Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important piece of information is the \"ONE WAY\" sign, clearly visible in Frames 3, 4, and 5. The arrow on this sign points definitively to the left.\n*   The other elements (truck, other cars, traffic lights) are less relevant to determining the one-way direction. The movement of other cars could be misleading if they were making turns. The one-way sign is the authoritative indicator.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left:** This aligns perfectly with the direction indicated by the \"ONE WAY\" sign.\n*   **B. Right:** This is the opposite of what the \"ONE WAY\" sign indicates.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
