  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the right-most lane. There's a solid white line separating ego's lane from the parking lane. There is a \"TAXI\" and \"MUNI\" sign painted on the road.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1, but the \"TAXI\" and \"MUNI\" sign is clearer, and there is an arrow pointing forward.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Ego is approaching a crosswalk. The lane markings are still visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important detail is the consistent \"TAXI\" and \"MUNI\" marking with a forward arrow in the lane where the ego vehicle is traveling. This indicates the lane is reserved for taxis and MUNI buses.\n    *   The solid white line to the right consistently indicates a parking lane, not a travel lane.\n    *   There are no signs of roadwork or closures.\n    *   Traffic density is not relevant to the lane restriction.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. It's for oncoming traffic:** Incorrect. The arrow points forward, and there's no double yellow line indicating oncoming traffic.\n    *   **B. It's closed for roadwork:** Incorrect. There are no signs or indicators of roadwork.\n    *   **C. Heavier traffic than required:** Incorrect. Traffic density is not the issue; the lane restriction is.\n    *   **D. It's not for passenger cars:** Correct. The \"TAXI\" and \"MUNI\" marking clearly indicates this lane is reserved for those vehicles.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
