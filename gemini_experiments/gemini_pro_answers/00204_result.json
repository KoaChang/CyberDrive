  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Two lanes are visible, separated by a dashed white line, indicating that both lanes travel in the same direction. A solid white line marks the right edge of the road. Traffic lights are visible in the distance. There is an SUV in the right lane.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The scene is similar to Frame 1. The SUV remains in the right lane. The traffic lights are closer.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The scene is similar to Frame 2. A white arrow pointing right is now visible on the road surface of the right lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The scene is similar to Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The right lane is now separated from the left lane by a solid white line. The right-turn arrow is much closer and clearly visible. The SUV is signaling a right turn.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames show a progression towards an intersection.\n    *   The dashed white line between the two lanes in the initial frames indicates both lanes travel in the same direction.\n    *   Frame 3 introduces a crucial element: a right-turn arrow painted on the right lane. This strongly suggests the right lane is a right-turn lane.\n    *   Frame 5 confirms this, as the dashed line becomes solid, further indicating the right lane is separate for turning. The SUV signaling reinforces this.\n    *   There are no other arrows or markings to suggest any other lanes turn right.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This aligns with the observation of a single right-turn arrow in the right lane.\n    *   **B. 2:** There's no visual evidence of a second right-turn lane.\n    *   **C. 3:** There's no visual evidence to support three right-turn lanes.\n    *   **D. 4:** There's no visual evidence to support four right-turn lanes.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best answer is A, as only the right lane has a right-turn arrow.\n\n    <answer>A</answer>\n"
