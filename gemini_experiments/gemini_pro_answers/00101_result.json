  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** An overhead sign is visible, but the exit number is partially obscured. We can see \"EXIT [obscured] B\" and \"North,\" along with \"Lampasas\" and an arrow pointing right for the exit. There are multiple lanes, and the car is not in the rightmost lane.\n*   **Frame 2:** The overhead sign is now clearly visible. It reads \"EXIT 240B,\" \"183 North,\" \"Lampasas,\" and \"EXIT ONLY\" with an arrow pointing right.\n*   **Frame 3:** The sign is now passing by and is less relevant.\n*    **Frame 4:** The sign is no longer visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** No relevant signs are visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most crucial information is in Frame 2, where the exit sign is fully visible. Frame 1 provides context, showing that an exit is approaching, but the number is not clear. Frames 3, 4 and 5 are less relevant as the sign has passed.\n*   The question asks for the *name* of the exit. Exit signs typically display a number and sometimes a letter.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 230B:** This is incorrect. Frame 2 clearly shows the exit number as 240B.\n*   **B. 240B:** This is consistent with the sign in Frame 2.\n*   **C. 250B:** This is incorrect. Frame 2 clearly shows the exit number as 240B.\n*   **D. Insufficient information:** This is incorrect. Frame 2 provides sufficient information.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
