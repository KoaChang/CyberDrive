  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** We see a multi-lane highway. There are signs on the right, but they are hard to read. The ego vehicle is in the center lane.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The scene is similar to Frame 1. The signs are still not clear.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The scene is similar to Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** We can now see overhead signs. The rightmost sign indicates 290 East. The two lanes below that sign have \"ONLY\" written on them.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The left lane has a left turn arrow. The two center lanes have straight arrows. The right lane has a right turn arrow.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about taking 290 East.\n    *   Frame 4 shows the overhead sign for 290 East above the two rightmost lanes.\n    *   Frame 5 shows the lane markings. The rightmost lane is a right-turn ONLY lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Right most lane:** Frame 5 shows that the rightmost lane is for right turns only, and Frame 4 shows the 290 East sign.\n    *   **B. Center lanes:** Frame 5 shows that the center lanes go straight.\n    *   **C. Left most lane:** Frame 5 shows that the left lane is for left turns only.\n    *   **D. Any lane:** This is incorrect, as the lane markings and signs restrict the choices.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the analysis, the rightmost lane is the correct lane to take 290 East.\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
