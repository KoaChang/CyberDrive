  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane road with a double yellow line separating the lanes. There's a dark-colored SUV in front. No lights are visible on the SUV.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The SUV is still ahead, and no lights are visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** The SUV's brake lights are clearly illuminated.\n*   **Frame 4:** The SUV's brake lights are still illuminated.\n*   **Frame 5:** The SUV's brake lights are still illuminated.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe key frames are 3, 4, and 5. In these frames, the vehicle in front has its brake lights on. The lights are consistently illuminated across multiple frames, indicating braking, not a momentary signal. There is no indication of a turn signal (left or right) or hazard lights (which would involve blinking on both sides).\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left turn signal:** Incorrect. Turn signals blink, and only one side would be lit.\n*   **B. Brake lights:** Correct. The consistent illumination of the lights in frames 3, 4, and 5 matches the behavior of brake lights.\n*   **C. Right turn signal:** Incorrect. Similar to option A, turn signals blink.\n*   **D. Hazard lights:** Incorrect. Hazard lights would involve blinking on both sides of the vehicle.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
