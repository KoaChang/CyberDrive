  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The road has two lanes, separated by a double yellow line, indicating no passing. There's a building on the left with \"COFFEE\" written. There is an intersection ahead with traffic lights. On the right, there are buildings with signs, but they are not yet readable.\n*   **Frame 2:** Approaching the intersection. The double yellow line continues. The building signs on the right are still not clear.\n*   **Frame 3:** Closer to the intersection. The traffic light is red. The double yellow line continues.\n*   **Frame 4:** Even closer to the intersection. A sign that says \"Polvos\" is now visible on the right side of the road, just before the intersection.\n*   **Frame 5:** Very close to the intersection. \"Polvos\" sign is clearly visible on the right.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The ego vehicle is traveling along a two-lane road with a double yellow line, meaning it cannot cross into the oncoming traffic lane.\n*   The \"Polvos\" sign is visible on the *right* side of the road, just *before* the intersection.\n*   The question asks what the ego vehicle should *do* to get to Polvos.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Turn left:** This is incorrect. Polvos is on the right.\n*   **B. Left lane change and then turn left:** This is incorrect. Polvos is on the right, and the double yellow line prohibits a lane change to the left.\n*   **C. Turn right:** This is the most logical action. Polvos is on the right, and the ego vehicle can turn right at the intersection.\n*   **D. Right lane change and then turn right:** This is incorrect. There's no right lane to change into; the ego vehicle is already in the right-most lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
