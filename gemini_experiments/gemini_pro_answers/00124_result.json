  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road appears to be a two-way street in a residential area, with cars parked on both sides. There's a slight curve to the left. No immediate hazards are visible, and no cone is yet in view.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The scene is largely the same as Frame 1. Still no cone.\n    *   **Frame 3:** An orange traffic cone appears in the center of the ego vehicle's lane. It's relatively far away.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The orange cone is now closer. The car is still approaching it.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The cone is even closer, still in the center of the lane.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The cone appears suddenly in Frame 3 and progressively gets closer. This indicates it's a stationary object in the ego vehicle's path.\n    *   The road is residential, suggesting lower speed limits, but hitting a cone is still undesirable and potentially damaging.\n    *   There are no visible lane markings to indicate it is not permissible to change lanes.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. No control required for the cone.** This is incorrect. A cone in the middle of the lane is an obstruction that needs to be addressed.\n    *   **B. Come to a full stop for the cone.** This is not the *best* option. While stopping would avoid hitting the cone, it's unnecessarily abrupt if a safer, smoother alternative exists. It might also create a hazard for any following traffic.\n    *   **C. Lane change to avoid the cone.** This is the most likely correct answer. Given the residential setting and the absence of oncoming traffic or restrictive lane markings, a lane change is the safest and most practical way to avoid the obstruction.\n    *   **D. Run over the cone.** This is incorrect. Intentionally running over an object is generally unsafe and could damage the vehicle or the cone, potentially creating a further hazard.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
