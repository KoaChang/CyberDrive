  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** A pedestrian in a t-shirt and shorts is visible, seemingly running, on the right side of the road, near the crosswalk. There's also a cyclist closer to the camera. Cars are parked along the right side of the road. The road has two lanes, separated by double yellow lines.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The pedestrian is closer to the crosswalk. The cyclist is still ahead of the pedestrian.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The pedestrian is even closer to the crosswalk, and the cyclist is still ahead.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The pedestrian is now in the crosswalk, running. The cyclist is further ahead.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The pedestrian is further into the crosswalk, still running, and has crossed the center line of the road. The cyclist is much further ahead.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about the pedestrian's movement *with respect to ego*. Ego is the dashcam vehicle.\n    *   The pedestrian starts on the right side of the road (from ego's perspective) and moves towards the left side, crossing the road's center.\n    *   The pedestrian's position changes significantly across the frames, indicating movement.\n    *   The cyclist's movement is not relevant to the question.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. In the same direction as ego:** Incorrect. The pedestrian is crossing the road, not moving along it in the same direction as the car.\n    *   **B. In the opposite direction of ego:** Incorrect. The pedestrian is crossing the road, not moving along it in the opposite direction.\n    *   **C. From left to right:** Incorrect. The pedestrian is clearly moving from the right side of the frame to the left.\n    *   **D. From right to left:** Correct. This aligns with the observed movement of the pedestrian across the frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
