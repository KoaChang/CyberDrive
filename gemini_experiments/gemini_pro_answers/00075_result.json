  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is behind a blue SUV. There is a truck with a flatbed trailer to the right. The lane ahead appears clear, with no obstructions immediately visible beyond the SUV. There are road signs and traffic lights in the distance.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The scene is very similar to Frame 1. The lane ahead still appears clear beyond the SUV.\n    *   **Frame 3:** A traffic cone becomes visible in the lane, positioned between ego and the blue SUV.\n    *   **Frame 4:** More traffic cones are now visible, further into the lane.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The cones are even closer, and it is clear that they are blocking the lane.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are 3, 4, and 5. While Frames 1 and 2 suggest a clear lane, the later frames reveal the presence of traffic cones.\n    *   The cones appear progressively closer, indicating that they are an obstruction in the lane ahead.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. It is clear to proceed:** This is incorrect. Frames 3, 4, and 5 clearly show traffic cones blocking the lane.\n    *   **B. There is a parked car in front:** This is incorrect. While there's an SUV, it's not stated to be parked, and the cones are the primary obstruction.\n    *   **C. There is a car with hazard lights on:** This is incorrect. There is no indication of hazard lights on any vehicle.\n    *   **D. There are traffic cones:** This is the correct answer, as clearly demonstrated in the later frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
