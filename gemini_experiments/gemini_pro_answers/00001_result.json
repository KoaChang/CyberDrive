  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the frames and the reasoning to determine the best answer:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There's a right-turn-only lane to the ego's right, indicated by road markings and a sign, but it's blocked by construction. Ego is in the lane to the left of the right-turn lane. There are other vehicles ahead, seemingly waiting to turn right.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. Ego vehicle is still behind other vehicles. The construction in the right-turn lane is clearly visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** Ego vehicle starts to move to the right, partially entering the construction zone. Other vehicles are still ahead, waiting.\n*   **Frame 4:** Ego vehicle is more into the construction zone, bypassing the waiting vehicles.\n*   **Frame 5:** Ego vehicle is almost fully past the line of waiting vehicles, still within the construction zone.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The ego vehicle's goal is to turn right.\n*   The designated right-turn lane is blocked by construction.\n*   Ego vehicle bypasses a queue of cars waiting to turn right by driving through the coned-off construction area.\n*   The maneuver is not about the width of the lane ahead, but about using a closed-off area to cut in line.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. It's legal as the lane is empty.** Incorrect. While the construction zone *is* empty of other cars, it's not a designated lane for travel, and it's being used to bypass other vehicles.\n*   **B. It's illegal as the right turn lane is blocked by construction.** While the right turn lane is blocked, this isn't the primary reason the maneuver is illegal. The illegality stems from using the *construction zone* to cut in line.\n*   **C. It's illegal as ego was cutting in other vehicles that were waiting.** This is the most accurate description. The ego vehicle is clearly bypassing a line of traffic.\n*   **D. It's legal but the lane ahead is way too narrow for ego to pass.** Incorrect. The legality isn't determined by the width of the lane ahead, but by the improper use of the construction zone.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
