  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is traveling in the right lane. A truck is in front of ego. There is a solid white line to the right, indicating the edge of the road or a shoulder. A dashed white line is to the left, which means ego can change lanes to the left.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1. An upcoming exit sign is visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Ego is approaching an exit-only lane. Traffic cones and directional arrows indicate the right lane must exit.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence shows a progression along a highway.\n    *   The most critical change occurs between Frame 4 and Frame 5. In Frame 5, it becomes clear that the current lane is becoming an exit-only lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Lane change to the left:** This is a viable option, as the dashed white line indicates it is permissible, and it is necessary to avoid being forced to exit.\n    *   **B. Lane change to the right:** This is not an option. There is a solid white line, and it is an exit-only lane.\n    *   **C. Continue in the current lane:** This is not a good option, as the lane becomes an exit-only lane.\n    *   **D. Come to a stop:** This is not a good option. Stopping on a highway is dangerous unless there's an emergency.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best action for ego to take is to change lanes to the left to avoid the upcoming exit.\n\n    <answer>A</answer>\n"
