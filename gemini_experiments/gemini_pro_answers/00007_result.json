There's a car parked on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane. There is a sign on the right.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The parked car is still there, and the sign is more visible, but its details are not clear.\n*   **Frame 3:** The parked car is closer, and the lane is still partially obstructed.\n*   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is very close to the parked car.\n*   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is still very close to the parked car.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The frames show a progression where the ego vehicle is approaching a parked car that is partially blocking the lane.\n*   There are no pedestrians visible in any of the frames.\n*   There is no indication of needing to turn left.\n*   The parked car represents an obstacle on the right.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A.
