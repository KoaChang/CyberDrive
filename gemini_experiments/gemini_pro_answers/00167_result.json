  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** A crosswalk is present. Several cars are parked on both sides of the road. An oncoming car is visible in the distance. It is difficult to tell if any lights are on.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The oncoming car is a bit closer. No lights are clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The oncoming car is even closer. No lights are clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The oncoming car is closer still. No lights are clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The oncoming car is very close. No lights are clearly visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks specifically about the *oncoming* car's lights.\n    *   Across all frames, there is no indication of turn signals (left or right) or hazard lights being activated on the oncoming car.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. No lights are on.** This aligns with the observations across all frames.\n    *   **B. Left turn light is on.** There's no visual evidence of a left turn signal.\n    *   **C. Right turn light is on.** There's no visual evidence of a right turn signal.\n    *   **D. Hazard lights are on.** There's no visual evidence of hazard lights (which would typically involve both turn signals blinking simultaneously).\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the consistent observation across all frames, the best answer is that no lights are visibly on for the oncoming car.\n\n    <answer>A</answer>\n"
