The speed limit sign is very clear.\n*   **Frame 5:** The vehicle is passing the speed limit sign.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important element across all frames is the speed limit sign.\n*   Frames 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the most crucial, as they show the sign clearly.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 35:** The speed limit sign does not show 35.\n*   **B. 30:** The speed limit sign does not show 30.\n*   **C. 25:** The speed limit sign shows 25.\n*   **D. 45:** The speed limit sign does not show 45.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
