  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is on a multi-lane highway. There's a solid yellow line to the left, indicating the median or edge of the lanes traveling in the ego vehicle's direction. To the right, there is a dashed white line. Further to the right, there is a solid white line. In the distance, many cars can be seen travelling in both directions.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The lane markings are consistent.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 1 and 2. The lane markings are consistent.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to previous frames. The lane markings remain consistent.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to previous frames. The lane markings remain consistent.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames consistently show a highway environment.\n    *   The solid yellow line consistently to the left indicates that all lanes to the right of that line are traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle.\n    *   The dashed white line indicates a lane that can be crossed.\n    *   The solid white line indicates the shoulder of the road, and is not a drivable lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This would be true if there was only one lane to the right of the yellow line, up to the first solid white line.\n    *   **B. 2:** This would be true if there were two lanes to the right of the yellow line, up to the first solid white line.\n    *   **C. 3:** This is not consistent with the visual evidence.\n    *   **D. 4:** This is not consistent with the visual evidence.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the consistent presence of the solid yellow line to the left, the dashed white line to the right, and the solid white line further to the right, there are two lanes travelling in the ego vehicle's direction.\n\n    <answer>B</answer>\n"
