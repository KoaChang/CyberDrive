  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** A dark-colored car is visible in the oncoming lane. It's relatively far away. There are parked cars on both sides of the street. The road has a double yellow line, and a bike lane is present on the right.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The oncoming car is closer. No turn signals are apparent.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The oncoming car is even closer. Still no visible turn signals.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The oncoming car is very close. No turn signals are on.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The oncoming car is passing the dashcam vehicle. No turn signals are visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The oncoming car travels at a consistent speed and maintains its position within its lane across all frames.\n    *   Crucially, there are no turn signals activated on the oncoming car in any of the frames.\n    *   The double yellow line indicates that passing or crossing the center line is prohibited.\n    *   There is no indication that the car is parked, as it is clearly moving towards the camera vehicle.\n    *   There is no indication that the car will reverse.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Intends to go straight:** This aligns with the car's consistent movement and lack of turn signals.\n    *   **B. Will reverse:** There's no evidence of this; the car is moving forward.\n    *   **C. Is parked:** This is incorrect; the car is clearly in motion.\n    *   **D. Will turn left:** This is unlikely, as there are no turn signals, and the car remains in its lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
