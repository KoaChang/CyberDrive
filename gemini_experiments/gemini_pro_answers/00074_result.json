  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is stopped at a red light at an intersection. There is a \"Commerce\" street sign, and a \"One Way\" sign pointing to the right. Several vehicles are visible, some stopped ahead and some in the cross street.\n*   **Frame 2:** The scene is almost identical to Frame 1.\n*   **Frame 3:** A white sedan begins to cross in front of the ego vehicle, moving from left to right.\n*   **Frame 4:** The white sedan has completely crossed and exited the frame. A silver sedan is now crossing from left to right.\n*   **Frame 5:** The silver sedan is still crossing. A white SUV has also entered the frame, crossing from left to right. A bus is visible on the far left, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The question asks about vehicles that *cross in front of* the ego vehicle and *completely exit the video frame*.\n*   The \"One Way\" sign indicates that traffic on Commerce street flows from left to right from the ego vehicle's perspective.\n*   The sequence of frames shows vehicles moving consistently with the one-way traffic flow.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 0:** Incorrect. We see at least one car completely cross.\n*   **B. 1:** Correct. The white sedan in Frames 3 and 4 is the only vehicle that fully crosses and exits.\n*   **C. 2:** Incorrect. The silver sedan and white SUV do not completely exit the frame.\n*    **D. 3:** Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
