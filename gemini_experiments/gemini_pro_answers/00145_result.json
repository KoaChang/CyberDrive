  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There are three lanes in the direction of travel. Construction barrels and signage are visible on the right side of the road, seemingly blocking the right-most lane. A crosswalk is present.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. The construction zone on the right is more clearly defined, with orange barrels and signs. The right lane appears fully blocked. Double yellow lines are present, and the lane lines are solid white.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The road markings are now clearer. The right lane is blocked by construction. The center lane has a solid white line on the right and a dashed white line on the left.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The \"Center Lane Closed\" sign is visible. However, the sign is placed on the right sidewalk, and the center lane is not blocked by any construction equipment.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks which lane is blocked *by construction*.\n    *   Frames 1, 2, and 3 clearly show the *right-most* lane is blocked by construction barrels and signs.\n    *   Frame 4 shows a sign that says \"Center Lane Closed\". However, there is no construction blocking the center lane. The sign is likely misplaced or refers to a future closure.\n    *   The ego vehicle is traveling straight, and the right lane is consistently blocked across multiple frames.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Left most lane:** No construction is present in the left lane.\n    *   **B. Center lane:** Although there's a \"Center Lane Closed\" sign, the lane itself isn't blocked by construction in any of the frames.\n    *   **C. Right most lane:** This aligns with the visible construction barriers in Frames 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect, as the right lane is clearly blocked.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best answer is C, as the right-most lane is consistently blocked by construction.\n\n    <answer>C</answer>\n"
