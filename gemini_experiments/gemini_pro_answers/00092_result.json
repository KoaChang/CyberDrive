  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in the right lane of a two-lane road, approaching an intersection. There's a double yellow line separating the lanes, and a solid white line on the right edge. A stop sign is visible in the distance, and a white car is stopped at the intersection.\n*   **Frame 2:** The scene is very similar to Frame 1. The ego vehicle is slightly closer to the intersection.\n*   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is even closer to the intersection. The stop sign is more prominent.\n*   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is approaching the stop line.\n*   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is very close to the stop line. A right-turn only sign is visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe frames show a progression of the ego vehicle approaching a stop sign at an intersection. The most crucial piece of information is the right-turn only sign visible in Frame 5. The double yellow lines indicate no passing, but don't restrict turning movements at an intersection. The ego vehicle is in the right lane, and the sign indicates that only a right turn is permitted from that lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left turn only:** This is incorrect. Frame 5 shows a right-turn only sign.\n*   **B. Right turn only:** This is consistent with the right-turn only sign in Frame 5.\n*   **C. Left turn and right turn:** This is incorrect. Frame 5 shows a right-turn only sign.\n*   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect, as option B is a valid maneuver.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
