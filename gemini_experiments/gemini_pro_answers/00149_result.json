  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** It is nighttime. There's a car ahead, slightly to the left, with visible brake lights. There is a solid white line on the right edge of the road, and a dashed white line separating the ego vehicle's lane from a lane to the left. A yield sign is visible on the left. There is also a sign on the right, but it is too dark to read.\n*   **Frame 2:** The car ahead is still visible. The road markings are the same. The sign on the right is still too dark to read.\n*   **Frame 3:** The car ahead is still visible. The road markings are the same. The sign on the right is becoming clearer.\n*   **Frame 4:** The car ahead is still visible. The road markings are the same. The sign on the right is now readable and says \"SPEED LIMIT 60\".\n*   **Frame 5:** The car ahead is still visible. The road markings are the same. The sign on the right is clearly readable and says \"SPEED LIMIT 60\".\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important element is the speed limit sign.\n*   The speed limit sign becomes progressively clearer, and is fully readable in Frames 4 and 5.\n*   The sign clearly states \"SPEED LIMIT 60\".\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 35:** Incorrect. The sign does not say 35.\n*   **B. 30:** Incorrect. The sign does not say 30.\n*   **C. 25:** Incorrect. The sign does not say 25.\n*   **D. 60:** Correct. The sign clearly indicates a speed limit of 60.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
