  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Four traffic lights are visible horizontally. The leftmost one displays a red left-turn arrow. The other three are circular and yellow. The road has two lanes in the driver's direction, separated by a dashed white line. A crosswalk is present.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The same four traffic lights are now all red. The road and lane configuration remain the same.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The traffic lights remain red. The scene is largely unchanged.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The traffic lights are still red. No significant changes.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The traffic lights are still red. No significant changes.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about traffic lights relevant for a \"going straight maneuver.\" This means we should focus on lights that control the through lanes, not turning lanes.\n    *   The leftmost light with the red arrow is clearly for left turns only.\n    *   The other three lights are circular and change from yellow to red, indicating they control the through traffic.\n    *   The two lanes ahead are both for going straight, as indicated by the dashed white line (which allows lane changes) and the absence of any turn arrows on the road surface or on dedicated turn-only signals.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** Incorrect. This would only account for one of the through-traffic lights.\n    *   **B. 2:** Incorrect. This would only account for two of the through-traffic lights.\n    *   **C. 3:** Correct. The three circular lights control the two lanes going straight.\n    *   **D. 4:** Incorrect. The fourth light is for left turns.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
