  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in a lane with double solid yellow lines to the left, and a dashed white line to the right. There's a Chevron gas station ahead. Traffic lights are visible, but their color isn't clear.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The dashed white line to the right continues.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The dashed white line to the right is becoming a solid white line.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The solid white line to the right is clear.\n    *   **Frame 5:** A clear, white, left-turn arrow is painted on the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most crucial frame is Frame 5. The presence of the left-turn arrow is the definitive indicator of the lane's permitted maneuver.\n    *   The progression of the white line from dashed to solid suggests the lane is transitioning, likely into a dedicated turn lane.\n    *   The double solid yellow lines to the left in earlier frames indicate that passing or crossing into oncoming traffic lanes is prohibited.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Right turn only:** Incorrect. Frame 5 shows a left-turn arrow.\n    *   **B. Go straight only:** Incorrect. Frame 5 shows a left-turn arrow.\n    *   **C. Left turn only:** This aligns with the left-turn arrow in Frame 5.\n    *   **D. Left turn and go straight:** Incorrect. There's no indication that going straight is permitted. The solid white line forming to the right suggests a lane division, making it unlikely that going straight would be allowed from the left-turn lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
