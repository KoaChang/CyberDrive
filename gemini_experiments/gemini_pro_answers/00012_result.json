  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road has multiple lanes. The vehicle is in the right-most lane. There's a sign on the right side of the road that says \"RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\", but it is partially obstructed. There are traffic lights ahead.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1, but the \"RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\" sign is more visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 2, but the \"RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\" sign is fully visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The vehicle and other cars are moving forward. The sign is now out of view.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The vehicle and other cars are still moving forward.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are Frames 1, 2, and 3, where the sign indicating the right lane's permitted maneuver is visible.\n    *   The sign clearly states \"RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\".\n    *   The other frames show the car moving, but don't provide additional information about lane restrictions.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Go straight only:** This is incorrect. The sign explicitly states the right lane must turn right.\n    *   **B. Turn right only:** This aligns with the sign \"RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT\".\n    *   **C. Go straight and turn right:** This is incorrect. The sign indicates a mandatory right turn.\n    *   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect, as option B matches the sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    <answer>B</answer>\n"
