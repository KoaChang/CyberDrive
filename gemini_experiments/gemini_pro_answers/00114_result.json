  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road is empty. There are multiple lanes, but no road markings are visible to indicate direction. There are traffic lights ahead.\n    *   **Frame 2:** A curved white arrow appears on the road, pointing right.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The curved white arrow is more defined, and a straight arrow is also visible in the same lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The straight arrow is more visible, and the curved right arrow is still present.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The lane markings are less visible, but the two arrows can still be made out.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are Frames 2, 3, and 4, where the lane markings become visible.\n    *   Frame 3 clearly shows both a right-curving arrow and a straight arrow within the ego vehicle's lane. This indicates that the lane allows for both right turns and proceeding straight.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Left only:** Incorrect. No left arrow is present.\n    *   **B. Straight only:** Incorrect. A right-curving arrow is also present.\n    *   **C. Right only:** Incorrect. A straight arrow is also present.\n    *   **D. Straight and right:** Correct. Frame 3 clearly shows both a straight arrow and a right-curving arrow in the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
