  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** A blue and white sign is visible on the right side of the road, but the words are illegible. There's a crosswalk, parked cars, and a clear road ahead.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The blue and white sign is slightly closer, but the words are still not clear.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The blue and white sign is still not clear.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The blue and white sign is still not clear.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The blue and white sign is closest and most legible in this frame. It is positioned on the right-hand sidewalk.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question specifically asks about the words on the blue and white sign.\n    *   The sign's visibility improves as the vehicle approaches it. Frame 5 offers the clearest view.\n    *   The other frames are less important, as the sign is not legible.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Do not enter:** This is typically a red and white sign, not blue and white.\n    *   **B. Stop:** Stop signs are red and white octagons.\n    *   **C. Bicycle:** While this could be on a blue sign, it usually has a bicycle symbol.\n    *   **D. Slow streets:** Frame 5 shows the words \"Slow Streets\" on the sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the clearest view in Frame 5, the sign reads \"Slow Streets\".\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
