  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the right lane. Multiple lanes are visible. No immediate obstructions. There is an overpass in the distance.\n*   **Frame 2:** Ego is still in the right lane. No significant changes.\n*   **Frame 3:** Ego begins to merge left. The lane to the right has construction barrels beginning to encroach.\n*   **Frame 4:** Ego is completing the lane change. The construction barrels are more visible, and the right lane is narrowing.\n*   **Frame 5:** Ego is fully in the left lane. The right lane is now clearly blocked by construction barrels.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe sequence of frames shows a clear progression. The most important frames are 3, 4, and 5. The construction barrels appear and progressively block the right lane, forcing the lane change.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left lane has better views:** There's no indication of this in the frames. The view is largely the same.\n*   **B. Current lane is exit only:** While there is an overpass, there are no signs indicating the right lane is exit only.\n*   **C. Current lane has a lower speed limit:** No speed limit signs are visible, and there's no reason to assume a speed limit change.\n*   **D. Current lane is blocked:** This is the most consistent with the visual evidence. The construction barrels clearly block the right lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
