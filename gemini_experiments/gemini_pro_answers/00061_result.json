  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A blue car is directly in front of the ego vehicle. Other cars (grey, red) are further ahead in adjacent lanes.\n*   **Frame 2:** The blue car remains directly in front. The relative positions of other cars are mostly unchanged.\n*   **Frame 3:** The blue car remains directly in front. The relative positions of other cars are mostly unchanged.\n*   **Frame 4:** The blue car remains directly in front. The relative positions of other cars are mostly unchanged.\n*   **Frame 5:** The blue car remains directly in front. The relative positions of other cars are mostly unchanged.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe question asks for the color of the car *immediately* in front. Across all five frames, a blue car consistently occupies that position. The other cars, while visible, are not *immediately* in front. The frames are sequential and show no overtaking maneuvers that would change which car is directly ahead.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Black:** No black car is immediately in front of the ego vehicle in any frame.\n*   **B. Blue:** A blue car is consistently and immediately in front.\n*   **C. Red:** A red car is visible, but it's in an adjacent lane and not directly in front.\n*   **D. White:** No white car is immediately in front.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
