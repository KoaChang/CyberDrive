  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road has a solid yellow line to the left, and white dashed lines to the right. There are multiple lanes of traffic, and a traffic light is visible in the distance. There is a sign with a right turn only arrow on the right side of the road.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The traffic light is closer.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** A left-turn arrow is now visible painted on the leftmost lane.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The left-turn arrow is more clearly visible. The car has moved forward.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames show a progression of the car approaching an intersection.\n    *   The most important clue is in Frames 4 and 5, where a left-turn arrow is painted on the road in the leftmost lane.\n    *   The solid yellow line on the left in all frames indicates that it's the edge of the drivable road in that direction, and not a lane.\n    *   The right turn only sign on the right indicates that the rightmost lane is for right turns only.\n    *   The question asks about the number of lanes that support a \"drive straight maneuver\".\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 5:** Incorrect. The leftmost lane is for left turns only, and the rightmost lane is for right turns only.\n    *   **B. 4:** Incorrect. The leftmost lane is for left turns only, and the rightmost lane is for right turns only.\n    *   **C. 3:** Correct. There are 5 lanes. The leftmost is left-turn only, and the rightmost is right-turn only. That leaves 3 lanes that can go straight.\n    *   **D. 2:** Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
