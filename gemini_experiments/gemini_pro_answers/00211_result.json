  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The dashcam view shows a multi-lane highway at night. There's an overhead sign that says \"Exit 289\" and \"Bangerter Hwy\". The car with the dashcam is in the second lane from the right. The right-most lane has a dashed line that is wider than a normal dashed line.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, but the car is slightly closer to the exit sign. The wide dashed lines are more visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The overhead sign consistently indicates \"Exit 289\" throughout all frames.\n    *   The wide dashed line on the right-most lane indicates that it is an exit-only lane.\n    *   The car with the dashcam is to the left of the exit-only lane.\n    *   The lane that the car with the dashcam is in has a solid white line to its right, which means that lane is able to take the exit.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This would be correct if there was only one lane that could take the exit.\n    *   **B. 2:** This would be correct if there were two lanes that could take the exit.\n    *   **C. 3:** This would be correct if there were three lanes that could take the exit.\n    *   **D. 4:** This would be correct if there were four lanes that could take the exit.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Based on the wide dashed line of the right-most lane, and the solid white line to the right of the car, there are two lanes that are able to take exit 289.\n\n    <answer>B</answer>\n"
