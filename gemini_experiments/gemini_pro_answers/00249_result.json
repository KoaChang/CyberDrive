  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego vehicle is in the left lane of two lanes going in the same direction. There's a solid white line separating the lanes, and a broken white line to the left of the ego, indicating a possible shoulder or bike lane. Traffic lights are visible ahead. A speed limit sign (35 mph) is posted. There is a sign that says \"HOV 2+ ONLY\" and \"6 AM - 10 AM\" and \"4 PM - 7 PM\".\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The solid white line continues. The traffic lights are still visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to Frame 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The ego vehicle remains in the left lane throughout all frames.\n    *   The solid white line between the ego's lane and the right lane indicates that lane changes are discouraged or possibly prohibited, depending on local traffic laws.\n    *   The sign indicates the right lane is an HOV lane during certain hours. It is not specified what the current time is.\n    *   There is no street sign that says \"Anza\" in any of the frames.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Ego should directly turn right from the current lane because the right lane is an HOV lane.** Incorrect. Turning right from the left lane across a solid white line and another lane is illegal and dangerous.\n    *   **B. Ego should immediately lane change to the right lane and then turn right.** Incorrect. The solid white line suggests a lane change is not permitted at this time.\n    *   **C. Ego can't lane change to the right lane because that is an HOV lane.** Partially correct, but not the complete picture. While it *might* be an HOV lane at the moment, the solid white line is the more immediate reason a lane change is prohibited.\n    *   **D. Ego should proceed through this intersection as it's not Anza street yet.** Correct. There is no indication of Anza street in any of the frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
