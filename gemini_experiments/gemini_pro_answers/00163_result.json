  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There's a parked car on the right, and a large truck ahead, partially blocking the view of the intersection. No clear road markings are visible yet.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The truck is more clearly in view, and a stop sign is visible on the right, attached to the truck. The ego vehicle is still approaching the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The truck and stop sign are even more prominent. The intersection is becoming clearer.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. A crosswalk is visible, and the word \"STOP\" is painted on the road. The truck is positioned across the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is at the stop line. The truck is blocking the road to the left. The crosswalk and \"STOP\" marking are clearly visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows the ego vehicle approaching a stop sign at an intersection.\n    *   The large truck is a significant factor. It's initially an obstruction, but as the ego vehicle gets closer, it becomes clear that the truck is stopped *across* the intersection, blocking the road to the left.\n    *   There are no visible lane markings or directional arrows to indicate specific turn restrictions.\n    *   The presence of the stop sign and the \"STOP\" painted on the road confirm that the ego vehicle *must* stop.\n    *   Because the truck is blocking the road to the left, a left turn is impossible.\n    *   There is no indication that a right turn is prohibited.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Turn left only:** Incorrect. The truck is blocking the left turn.\n    *   **B. Turn right only:** This is the most plausible option. The left turn is blocked, and there's no visual evidence prohibiting a right turn.\n    *   **C. Turn left and turn right:** Incorrect. The left turn is blocked.\n    *   **D. U-turn only:** Incorrect. There's no indication that a U-turn is required or even allowed, and it's generally not permitted at intersections with stop signs unless specifically indicated.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
