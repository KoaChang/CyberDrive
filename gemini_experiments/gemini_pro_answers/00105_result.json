  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** On the right side of the road, a large, white RV is parked. Further down the road, there are orange and white construction barriers. A yellow taxi is parked on the right, and a dark sedan is parked behind it.\n*   **Frame 2:** The RV is still visible and closer. The construction barriers are also closer. The taxi and sedan are still visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** The RV is even closer and now alongside the ego vehicle. The construction barriers are still visible in the distance.\n*   **Frame 4:** The RV is no longer visible, having been passed. The construction barriers are closer.\n*   **Frame 5:** A large construction truck is now visible, parked on the right side of the road, behind the construction barriers.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\nThe question asks about the vehicle closest to \"ego\" (the dashcam vehicle) on the *right* side of the road. The frames show a progression as the ego vehicle drives down the street. The RV is initially the closest, but it is passed. The construction truck becomes visible in the last frame.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Construction Truck:** This is visible in Frame 5, and it is on the right.\n*   **B. RV:** This is visible in Frames 1-3, but it is passed by the ego vehicle.\n*   **C. Mini-van:** There is no mini-van visible on the right side of the road in any of the frames.\n*   **D. Bicycle:** There is no bicycle visible in any of the frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\nGiven the progression and the final frame, the construction truck is the closest vehicle on the right side of the road *at the end of the sequence*.\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
