  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the left of two forward lanes. To the right is a lane with \"ONLY\" painted, and a bus icon. There is also a taxi in that lane. There are multiple traffic lights, all green.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The bus/taxi lane is more clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The word \"BUS\" is now clearly visible in the right lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The word \"TAXI\" is now clearly visible in the right lane.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The right lane now has an arrow pointing right, and the word \"ONLY\".\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows the ego vehicle approaching an intersection.\n    *   The most important detail is the signage and road markings in the lane to the right of the ego vehicle. Across the frames, it becomes clear that the lane is designated for buses and taxis, and in Frame 5, it is shown to be a right-turn-only lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. The lane to the right is a shoulder:** This is incorrect. The lane markings and the presence of other vehicles (bus, taxi) indicate it's a travel lane, not a shoulder.\n    *   **B. The lane to the right is blocked by an obstacle:** This is incorrect. While there are vehicles in the lane, they are not stationary \"obstacles\" in the sense of blocking the lane's intended use.\n    *   **C. The lane to the right is only for buses and taxis:** This is correct, and supported by the road markings (\"ONLY\", \"BUS\", \"TAXI\") visible in Frames 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   **D. The lane to the right is currently occupied by another vehicle:** While true at times, this isn't the *primary* reason a lane change would be inappropriate. The lane's designation is more important.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
