  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A stop sign is visible on the right, along with a \"One Way\" sign below it with a right-pointing arrow. The road appears to curve to the right. There is also a sign on the left, but it is hard to read.\n*   **Frame 2:** The stop sign and one-way sign are clearer. The road markings are still not entirely visible, but the curve to the right is evident.\n*   **Frame 3:** The car is closer to the intersection. The one-way sign is very clear.\n*   **Frame 4:** The car is even closer to the stop sign.\n*   **Frame 5:** The car has almost reached the stop line.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The presence of a stop sign indicates that the ego vehicle *must* come to a complete stop before proceeding.\n*   The \"One Way\" sign with a right-pointing arrow, positioned directly below the stop sign, dictates the only permissible direction of travel after stopping.\n*   The road's curvature also suggests a right turn.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Turn left:** This is incorrect. The \"One Way\" sign explicitly prohibits a left turn.\n*   **B. Go straight:** This is incorrect. There is no straight option, and the \"One Way\" sign directs traffic to the right.\n*   **C. Turn right:** This is the correct option. The \"One Way\" sign, combined with the stop sign, indicates that the only legal maneuver is to stop and then turn right.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
