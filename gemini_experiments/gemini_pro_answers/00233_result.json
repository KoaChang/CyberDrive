  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** A solid white line is present on the right side of the road. A solid double yellow line is present to the left of ego. There is a construction barrier on the right. There are multiple cars and a bus ahead.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The same lines are present. The construction barrier is still present.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The same lines are present. The construction barrier is still present.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The same lines are present. The construction barrier is still present.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The same lines are present. The construction barrier is still present.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The solid white line on the right indicates the edge of the roadway or a separation from a shoulder, not a lane division.\n    *   The solid double yellow lines to the left indicate that there are lanes of traffic going in the opposite direction.\n    *   There is no dashed line to the left of ego, so there is only one lane in ego's direction of travel.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This aligns with the observation of a single lane demarcated by the solid white line on the right and the double yellow lines on the left.\n    *   **B. 2:** There's no evidence of a second lane in the direction of travel. No dashed white lines are present.\n    *   **C. 3:** There's no evidence of a third lane.\n    *   **D. 4:** There's no evidence of a fourth lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
