  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** There's an overhead sign. The leftmost lane has a left-turn arrow. The next two lanes have straight arrows. The rightmost lane is not fully visible. There is a solid yellow line on the left, indicating the edge of the roadway or a divider.\n*   **Frame 2:** The overhead sign is clearer. Leftmost lane: left-turn arrow. Next two lanes: straight arrows. Rightmost lane: straight arrow.\n*   **Frame 3:** The overhead sign is very clear, with the same arrow configuration as Frame 2. A sign on the left states \"LEFT LANE MUST ENTER RAMP\". The word \"ONLY\" is painted on the leftmost lane.\n*   **Frame 4:** Similar to previous frames, but the \"ONLY\" marking and the left-lane sign are less visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** Similar to previous frames.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The overhead sign consistently shows a single left-turn arrow for the leftmost lane across all frames.\n*   Frame 3 is crucial. It includes the \"LEFT LANE MUST ENTER RAMP\" sign and the \"ONLY\" marking on the road, confirming that only the leftmost lane can take the left fork. The other lanes have straight arrows, indicating they must go straight.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 1:** This aligns with the visual evidence. The leftmost lane is the only one with a left-turn arrow and is explicitly marked as mandatory for the ramp.\n*   **B. 2:** Incorrect. The overhead sign and road markings clearly show only one left-turn lane.\n*   **C. 3:** Incorrect. Only one lane is designated for the left turn.\n*   **D. 4:** Incorrect. Only one lane is designated for the left turn.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
