  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** There's ongoing construction to the right, indicated by orange cones and a green construction fence. The cones start to veer left, blocking off the right-most lane. There are two lanes of travel, separated by double yellow lines.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The cones continue to block off the right lane. The two lanes of travel are still visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The cones are still blocking the right lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Fewer cones are visible, but the right lane is still blocked.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Only one cone is visible. The right lane is still blocked.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The consistent presence of cones and the construction fence across all frames indicates a continuous blockage of the right-most lane.\n    *   The double yellow lines indicate two lanes of travel.\n    *   The cones are placed to divert traffic away from the right lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 0:** Incorrect. The cones and fence clearly show a blockage.\n    *   **B. 1:** Correct. The cones consistently block off one lane.\n    *   **C. 2:** Incorrect. There are only two lanes, and only one is blocked.\n    *   **D. 3:** Incorrect. There aren't even three lanes to block.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
