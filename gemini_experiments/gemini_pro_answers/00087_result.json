  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Several cars are parked on the right side of the road. A bus is in the oncoming lane. A sign indicates a bus lane ahead.\n*   **Frame 2:** More parked cars are visible on the right. The ego vehicle is approaching the parked cars.\n*   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is passing the parked cars.\n*   **Frame 4:** The last parked car is passed.\n*   **Frame 5:** No parked cars are visible on the right.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    The question asks how many *unique* parked cars were passed. We need to count each car only once. The frames show a continuous sequence, and we can track the cars as the ego vehicle moves forward.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 2:** This is too few. Frames 1 and 2 clearly show more than two parked cars.\n*   **B. 6:** This seems like a reasonable estimate.\n*   **C. 10:** This is too many.\n*    **D. None:** This is incorrect, as parked cars are clearly visible.\n\n4. Counting the cars.\n    * Frame 1 shows at least 4 cars.\n    * Frame 2 shows at least 2 additional cars for a total of 6.\n    * Frame 3 and 4 show the ego passing these cars.\n\n5.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
