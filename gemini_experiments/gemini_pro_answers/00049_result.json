  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A roundabout sign and a speed limit sign (20 MPH) are visible. There are other cars ahead. It is night.\n*   **Frame 2:** The roundabout sign is clearer. The speed limit sign is also clearer.\n*   **Frame 3:** Highway signs for I-75 and I-85 appear. A sign below indicates \"N Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\".\n*   **Frame 4:** The \"N Monroe Drive\" and \"Armour Drive\" sign is clearer, but the directional arrow is still not fully visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** The sign is most clear. \"Monroe Drive\" has an arrow pointing up (or straight). \"Armour Drive\" has an arrow pointing to the right.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The sequence of frames shows the car approaching a roundabout.\n*   The critical information is on the sign that becomes progressively clearer, especially in Frames 3, 4 and 5.\n*   Frame 5 provides the clearest view of the directional arrows for Monroe Drive and Armour Drive.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Straight:** Frame 5 shows the arrow for Monroe Drive pointing upwards, which corresponds to going straight through the roundabout relative to the car's initial approach.\n*   **B. Left:** There is no indication of a left turn for Monroe Drive.\n*   **C. Right:** The arrow pointing right is associated with Armour Drive, not Monroe Drive.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
