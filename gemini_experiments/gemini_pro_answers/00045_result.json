  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Three lanes are visible, separated by dashed white lines. A green sign that says \"Greer Road\" is visible. No construction is immediately obvious.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. Three lanes, dashed white lines. The \"Greer Road\" sign is closer. Still no obvious construction.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The scene is largely the same. Three lanes.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Orange traffic cones are now visible, starting to encroach on the left-most lane. A worker in a safety vest is also visible near the cones.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The cones and worker are much closer, clearly blocking the left-most lane.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    The progression of the frames shows the dashcam vehicle approaching a construction zone. The first three frames give no indication of blockage. Frames 4 and 5, however, progressively reveal orange cones and a worker obstructing the left-most lane. The other lanes remain clear.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Left most lane:** This aligns with the observations in Frames 4 and 5.\n    *   **B. Center lane:** The center lane remains clear throughout all frames.\n    *   **C. Right most lane:** The right-most lane also remains clear.\n    *   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect, as the left lane is clearly blocked in the later frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
