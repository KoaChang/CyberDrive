  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in a lane with a dashed white line to the left and a solid white line to the right. There's an intersection ahead with traffic signals. A sign on the right indicates the left lane is for a left turn only.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, approaching the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 1 and 2, approaching the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to Frame 1, 2 and 3, approaching the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Ego is still in the same lane. The dashed white line to the left and solid white line to the right are still present.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important clue is the sign in Frame 1, which states \"Left Lane Must Turn Left.\"\n    *   Ego's lane is *not* the left lane. It is to the right of the left lane.\n    *   The lane markings (dashed white to the left, solid white to the right) indicate that ego can proceed in the current lane or merge left.\n    *   There are no signs or markings to suggest a right turn is permitted or required from ego's lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Left only:** Incorrect. The sign applies to the lane to the *left* of ego's lane.\n    *   **B. Straight or Left:** Correct. Ego can continue straight, and the dashed line on the left indicates merging left is permitted.\n    *   **C. Straight only:** Incorrect. The dashed line on the left indicates that a lane change to the left is permitted.\n    *   **D. Right only:** Incorrect. There are no signs or markings indicating a right turn is allowed or required.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
