  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A two-lane road with double yellow lines is visible. A car is ahead. A sign for \"Louis Muellers Meat\" is on the right. A traffic light is visible in the distance.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, but closer to the traffic light. The \"Louis Muellers Meat\" sign is clearer.\n*   **Frame 3:** The traffic light is closer and now clearly visible. There are two sets of lights, one on the left and one on the right. The right light has an orange flashing light.\n*   **Frame 4:** Even closer to the traffic light. The school zone sign is now visible, with two orange flashing lights.\n*   **Frame 5:** The closest to the traffic light. The school zone sign is very clear, with two orange flashing lights.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The question asks about the number of *flashing* light bulbs.\n*   Frames 1 and 2 do not show any flashing lights.\n*   Frame 3 shows one flashing orange light on the right traffic signal.\n*   Frames 4 and 5 show the school zone sign with two flashing orange lights, in addition to the traffic signal's flashing light.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 1:** This would be correct if we only considered Frame 3.\n*   **B. 2:** This would be the number of flashing lights on the school zone sign.\n*   **C. 3:** This is the total number of flashing lights visible in Frames 4 and 5.\n*   **D. 4:** There is no point where four flashing lights are visible.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\nThe best answer is C, as there are three flashing lights visible in the later frames: two on the school zone sign and one on the traffic signal.\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
