  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A large white truck is ahead, moving in the same direction as the dashcam vehicle. Double yellow lines separate the lanes. The truck's brake lights are not illuminated. There is an intersection ahead.\n*   **Frame 2:** The truck is slightly closer. The truck's brake lights are now illuminated.\n*   **Frame 3:** The truck is even closer. The truck's right turn signal is activated.\n*   **Frame 4:** The truck is still close. The right turn signal is still on. A stop sign is visible to the right, at the intersection.\n*   **Frame 5:** The truck is slightly further away, and the right turn signal is still on.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The truck's consistent use of its right turn signal, starting in Frame 3 and continuing through Frames 4 and 5, is the most critical piece of information.\n*   The stop sign in Frames 3, 4 and 5 confirms the presence of an intersection.\n*   The truck's brake lights are on in Frame 2, indicating it is slowing down.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left:** The truck's right turn signal contradicts this.\n*   **B. Straight:** The truck's right turn signal contradicts this.\n*   **C. Right:** The truck's right turn signal, activated consistently across multiple frames, strongly supports this.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
