  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. The traffic lights are green. There's a crosswalk, and a street sign that reads \"FM 969\". There are yellow warning signs to the right.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, but closer to the intersection. The road markings are still not clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is even closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The crosswalk is more visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is entering the intersection. The crosswalk is clearly visible. One of the yellow warning signs now reads \"Road Narrows\".\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The traffic lights are consistently green across all frames, indicating that the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed.\n    *   The \"Road Narrows\" sign in Frame 5 suggests a potential change in road configuration ahead, but it doesn't mandate an immediate lane change.\n    *   There is no visible debris on the road.\n    *   There is no indication of an upcoming highway entrance or a need to speed up.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Continue straight in a nominal scenario:** This aligns with the green traffic light and the absence of any immediate need to change lanes.\n    *   **B. Veer left for a merge:** There's no visual evidence of a merge situation requiring a left veer.\n    *   **C. Veer left for debris:** No debris is visible in any of the frames.\n    *   **D. Speed up for the upcoming highway:** There's no indication of an upcoming highway.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
