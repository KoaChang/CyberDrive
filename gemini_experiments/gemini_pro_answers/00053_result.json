  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** There is a solid white line on the right, a dashed white line in the middle, and a solid yellow line on the far left. The ego vehicle is to the right of the dashed white line.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The road markings are consistent across all frames.\n    *   The solid white line on the right indicates the edge of the roadway or a shoulder (which we are told to ignore).\n    *   The dashed white line indicates a separation between lanes traveling in the same direction.\n    *   The solid yellow line indicates the boundary with oncoming traffic lanes.\n    *   The ego vehicle is in the right-most lane that is not the shoulder.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 3:** Incorrect. There is only one dashed white line, which means there are only two lanes going in the same direction.\n    *   **B. 4:** Incorrect. Same reasoning as above.\n    *   **C. 1:** Incorrect. There is a dashed white line, which means there is another lane going in the same direction.\n    *   **D. 2:** Correct. The dashed white line indicates two lanes going in the same direction.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
