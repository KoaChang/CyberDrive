  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** There is a pedestrian crossing sign and a \"Bus Stop\" sign. There are double yellow lines in the center of the road. There are no visible traffic lights.\n    *   **Frame 2:** There is now a crosswalk. There are no visible traffic lights.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2, no traffic lights are visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to previous frames, no traffic lights are visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to previous frames, no traffic lights are visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks specifically about *flashing* traffic light bulbs.\n    *   Across all five frames, there are no traffic lights visible at all, flashing or otherwise. The focus is on a street with parked cars, road markings, and some signage (pedestrian crossing, bus stop), but no traffic signals.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 0:** This aligns with the observation that no traffic lights are seen.\n    *   **B. 2:** No traffic lights are visible.\n    *   **C. 4:** No traffic lights are visible.\n    *   **D. 6:** No traffic lights are visible.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best answer is the one that reflects the absence of any flashing traffic light bulbs.\n\n    <answer>A</answer>\n"
