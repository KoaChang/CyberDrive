  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is traveling on a multi-lane road. The traffic lights ahead are green. There are no immediately visible obstructions.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, the road continues, and the traffic lights remain green. No obstructions are visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** A \"No Left Turn\" sign is now clearly visible on the right-hand side traffic light pole at the intersection. The street sign reads \"36th Avenue\".\n    *   **Frame 4:** The \"No Left Turn\" sign is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is approaching the intersection. The \"No Left Turn\" sign is no longer visible, but its prior presence is crucial.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames show a progression of the ego vehicle approaching an intersection.\n    *   The most critical piece of information is the \"No Left Turn\" sign that appears in Frames 3 and 4. This sign directly prohibits the action in question.\n    *   There's no evidence of construction or other vehicles blocking the road in a way that would prevent a left turn *if* it were permitted.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. The road is blocked by construction:** No construction is visible in any of the frames.\n    *   **B. The road is blocked by other vehicles:** While other vehicles are present, none are blocking the left turn lane in a way that would make the turn impossible (if it were legal).\n    *   **C. There is a no left turn sign:** This is directly supported by Frames 3 and 4.\n    *   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect because option C is valid.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    <answer>C</answer>\n"
