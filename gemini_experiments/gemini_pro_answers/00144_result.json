  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The road is divided. There is a left-turn lane with a painted arrow, and a center lane with a straight arrow. There is a sign on the left and right that is hard to read.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The road remains divided as in Frame 1. The signs are a bit clearer, and they indicate the left lane is left turn only, and the right lane is right turn only.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The road remains divided as in previous frames. The traffic lights are red.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The road is now divided into four lanes. From left to right: left turn only, straight only, straight or right turn, and right turn only.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The road remains divided into four lanes, as in Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important frames are Frame 4 and Frame 5, as they show the intersection in question.\n    *   Frame 4 clearly shows the lane markings.\n    *   The question asks about the number of lanes that go *straight*.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** Incorrect. Frame 4 shows two lanes going straight.\n    *   **B. 2:** Correct. Frame 4 shows one lane going only straight, and another lane going straight or right.\n    *   **C. 3:** Incorrect.\n    *   **D. 4:** Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
