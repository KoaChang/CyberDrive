  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in a lane with a solid white line to its right and a dashed white line to its left. There are at least two other lanes to the left, separated by dashed white lines. There is a concrete barrier and a solid yellow line to the far left. There is a solid white line to the far right.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The solid yellow line on the far left indicates the leftmost boundary of the roadway, and the solid white line on the far right indicates the rightmost boundary.\n    *   Dashed white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.\n    *   The ego vehicle remains in the same lane throughout all frames.\n    *   There are consistently two dashed white lines to the left of the ego vehicle, and a solid white line to the right.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** Incorrect. There are clearly multiple lanes.\n    *   **B. 2:** Incorrect. There are two dashed white lines to the left of the ego vehicle, indicating three lanes.\n    *   **C. 3:** Incorrect. There are three lanes to the left of the yellow barrier.\n    *   **D. 4:** Correct. The ego vehicle's lane, plus the two lanes to its left, plus the lane to its right, make a total of four lanes.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
