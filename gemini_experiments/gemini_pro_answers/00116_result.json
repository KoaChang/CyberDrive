  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Three lanes are visible, separated by dashed white lines. A sign is partially visible on the left, and a sign related to construction is on the right. The road curves slightly to the left.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The road continues to curve slightly left.\n*   **Frame 3:** The left-hand sign becomes more visible, but the text is still not entirely clear.\n*   **Frame 4:** The sign on the left is now readable. It shows \"Airport Blvd\" with a left arrow.\n*   **Frame 5:** The sign is very clear. \"Airport Blvd\" has a left arrow, and the other options have straight arrows.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important piece of information is the sign in Frames 4 and 5. It clearly indicates that \"Airport Blvd\" is a left turn.\n*   The car is in the right most lane.\n*   The question asks which lane is needed to go to Airport Blvd.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left most lane only.** This is consistent with the sign that indicates a left turn for Airport Blvd.\n*   **B. Left most lane and center lane.** There is no indication that the center lane can turn left.\n*   **C. Right most lane only.** This is incorrect. The sign indicates a left turn.\n*    **D. Right most lane and center lane.** This is incorrect. The sign indicates a left turn.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
