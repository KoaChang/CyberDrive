  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Ego is approaching a 4-way intersection with a stop sign. There is an emergency vehicle (fire truck) with flashing lights in the distance, approaching the intersection from the opposite direction. There are cars parked on both sides of the street. The lane markings show a solid double yellow line in the center, and a broken white line to the right of ego.\n*   **Frame 2:** The scene is very similar to Frame 1. The emergency vehicle is slightly closer. Ego is closer to the stop line.\n*   **Frame 3:** The emergency vehicle is even closer. Ego is even closer to the stop line.\n*   **Frame 4:** The emergency vehicle is much closer. Ego is very close to the stop line.\n*   **Frame 5:** The emergency vehicle is at the intersection. Ego is at the stop line.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The presence of a stop sign indicates that ego *must* come to a complete stop.\n*   The approaching emergency vehicle with flashing lights requires other vehicles to yield the right-of-way.\n*   The question asks what ego *should* do, implying the legally and safely correct action.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. turn right:** This is incorrect. While turning right might eventually be an option *after* stopping and yielding, it's not the immediate required action.\n*   **B. pullover and yield for the emergency vehicle:** This is incorrect. There are cars parked on the right, so pulling over is not possible.\n*   **C. turn left:** This is incorrect. Similar to turning right, this is not the immediate required action and would obstruct the emergency vehicle.\n*   **D. come to a stop and then proceed from stop sign:** This is the most appropriate action. Ego must stop at the stop sign, and because of the emergency vehicle, must remain stopped until the fire truck has passed.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
