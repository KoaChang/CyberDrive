  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There's a \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" sign and some traffic cones visible in the distance, slightly to the right, suggesting a potential lane closure or redirection of traffic ahead. Parked cars line both sides of the street. There are no visible lane markings to indicate turning restrictions.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, but closer to the \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" sign. A \"DETOUR\" sign with a right-pointing arrow is now visible beneath the \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" sign.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" and \"DETOUR\" signs are even closer. The road ahead appears to be blocked.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The signs are closer.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is much closer to the intersection. The \"DETOUR\" sign clearly indicates a right turn. The road straight ahead is blocked by construction barriers.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows the ego vehicle approaching a road closure.\n    *   The \"DETOUR\" sign with the right-pointing arrow becomes increasingly prominent, indicating that the intended straight-ahead path is blocked.\n    *   The question asks about the best action for ego, given that the navigation route is to go straight.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Turn Left:** There is no indication of a left turn being required or even possible.\n    *   **B. Go Straight:** The frames clearly show the road ahead is blocked, making this impossible.\n    *   **C. Turn Right:** This aligns with the \"DETOUR\" sign's instruction.\n    *   **D. Reverse:** Reversing is not necessary and would likely be unsafe.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    Although the ego vehicle's navigation route is to go straight, the presence of the \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" sign, the \"DETOUR\" sign pointing right, and the visible road blockage, all indicate that the best action is to turn right.\n\n    <answer>C</answer>\n"
