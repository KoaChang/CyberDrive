  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** We see a multi-lane highway. There are overhead signs, but the details are not yet clear. There are dashed lane dividers.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The overhead signs become slightly clearer. We can start making out the text.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The signs are readable. The left sign indicates \"Harrison St, Embarcadero\" with a downward arrow. The right sign indicates \"Fremont St, Folsom St, Exit Only\" with a downward arrow pointing to the rightmost lane.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The \"Exit Only\" designation for the rightmost lane is very clear. The lane markings are still dashed.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Critically, we now see road markings. The rightmost lane has a right-turn arrow, and the lane next to it has a straight-ahead arrow *and* a right-turn arrow. The other lanes have only straight-ahead arrows.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The overhead signs in Frames 3 and 4 indicate that the rightmost lane is \"Exit Only.\"\n    *   Frame 5's road markings are the most crucial piece of information. They show that *both* the rightmost lane and the lane immediately to its left allow for taking the exit. The rightmost is exit only, and the one to the left of it is optional.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Only rightmost:** Incorrect. Frame 5 shows the lane next to the rightmost also allows exiting.\n    *   **B. Right two lanes:** Correct. Frame 5 clearly shows right-turn arrows in the two rightmost lanes.\n    *   **C. Right three lanes:** Incorrect. Only two lanes have right-turn arrows.\n    *   **D. Leftmost lane:** Incorrect. The leftmost lane is clearly for going straight.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
