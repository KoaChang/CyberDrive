  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is traveling in a lane with a double yellow line to the left, indicating no passing. There are parked cars on the right. A white SUV is ahead, and a large truck is partially visible, stopped, in the oncoming lane. The road appears wet.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The truck remains stopped. A traffic light is now visible, and it appears yellow.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The traffic light is now more clearly yellow. A stop sign is also visible. The truck is still stopped.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The stop sign is very clear. The truck has cleared the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The stop sign is directly to the right of ego.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows ego approaching an intersection.\n    *   The presence of a yellow light in Frames 2 and 3, followed by a clear stop sign in Frames 3, 4, and 5, is the most critical observation. The yellow light is a warning, but the stop sign dictates the required action.\n    *   The wet road conditions are a secondary factor, suggesting caution is needed.\n    *   The truck's initial presence and subsequent clearing of the intersection are relevant to situational awareness but don't change the fundamental requirement imposed by the stop sign.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Continue at the same speed:** Incorrect. This violates the stop sign and ignores the yellow light warning.\n    *   **B. Slow down but do not come to a stop:** Incorrect. This violates the stop sign.\n    *   **C. Come to a stop:** Correct. This is the required action at a stop sign.\n    *   **D. Speed up:** Incorrect. This is dangerous and violates both the implied caution of the yellow light and the explicit requirement of the stop sign.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
