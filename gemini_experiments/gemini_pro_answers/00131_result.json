  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is approaching an intersection. There are multiple traffic lights visible. The lane markings show a solid white line to the right, indicating the edge of the roadway, and a broken white line to the left, separating ego's lane from the next. The right-most traffic light appears to be a red right arrow.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The red right arrow is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 1 and 2. The red right arrow is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Similar to previous frames. The red right arrow is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Similar to previous frames. The red right arrow is still visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   Ego is consistently in the right-most lane, as indicated by the solid white line on the right and broken white line on the left.\n    *   The traffic light relevant to ego's lane is consistently a red right arrow across all frames.\n    *   The question asks for the color and shape of the traffic light.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Red Right Arrow:** This aligns perfectly with the observations from all frames.\n    *   **B. Red Left Arrow:** This is incorrect. There's no indication of a left arrow, and it wouldn't be relevant to the right-most lane.\n    *   **C. Red Circle:** This is incorrect. While there might be other red lights, the specific light controlling the right turn is an arrow.\n    *   **D. Yellow Left Arrow:** This is incorrect. There's no yellow light visible, and a left arrow is irrelevant.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
