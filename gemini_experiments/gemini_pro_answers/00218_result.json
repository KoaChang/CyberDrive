  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Two solid yellow lines are in the center. To the right, there are two sets of white dashed lines, indicating at least three lanes. There are lane designation signs. The leftmost sign has a left-turn-only arrow. The sign below it has a straight-ahead arrow and a left-turn arrow. The traffic light has a green left arrow.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The lane markings and signs are still visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2. The lane markings are still visible.\n*   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is approaching the intersection. The road markings are clearer. There is a left-turn-only lane, and to the right of that are three lanes with \"CLEAR KEEP\" written on them.\n*   **Frame 5:** Similar to Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The question asks about the number of lanes *at the intersection*. Frame 4 is the most informative, as the ego vehicle is closest to the intersection, and the road markings are clear.\n*   The presence of the \"CLEAR KEEP\" markings in three lanes, and a left-turn-only lane, indicates that there are four lanes.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. 3:** Incorrect. Frame 4 shows there are at least four lanes.\n*   **B. 4:** Correct. Frame 4 shows a left-turn-only lane, and three other lanes.\n*   **C. 5:** Incorrect.\n*   **D. 6:** Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
