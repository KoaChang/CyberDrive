  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is approaching an intersection. There is a solid yellow line on the left, and a solid white line on the right. The traffic light is green.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1, but closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 2, but closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Two left-turn-only lanes are visible, marked with left-turn arrows.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 4.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks which lane to take for a left turn at the intersection, *followed immediately by a right turn*.\n    *   Frames 4 and 5 clearly show two dedicated left-turn lanes.\n    *   To prepare for an immediate right turn *after* the left turn, ego should be in the *rightmost* of the available left-turn lanes. This will position the vehicle to easily make the subsequent right turn.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. 1:** This is the leftmost of the left-turn lanes. It's a valid left-turn lane, but not the best choice for a subsequent right turn.\n    *   **B. 2:** This is the rightmost of the two left-turn lanes. This is the optimal position for making a right turn immediately after the left.\n    *   **C. 3:** This lane does not permit a left turn.\n    *   **D. 4:** This lane does not permit a left turn.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n    The best answer is B, as lane 2 is the right-most lane that allows a left turn.\n\n    <answer>B</answer>\n"
