  "answer": "1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in the leftmost lane. There's a solid white line to the left, and a dashed white line to the right, separating the ego vehicle's lane from the next lane. A \"Left Turn Only\" sign is visible on the left side of the road, and the traffic light is green.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1. The \"Left Turn Only\" sign is more clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1 and 2.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1, 2, 3, and 4. The lane marking on the road is visible, and it indicates a left-turn-only arrow.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    The frames consistently show the ego vehicle in the leftmost lane. The presence of the \"Left Turn Only\" sign, combined with the left-turn arrow road marking in Frame 5, indicates that this lane is exclusively for left turns. The green light doesn't change the restriction imposed by the lane marking and sign.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Yes:** This is incorrect. The lane markings and sign clearly indicate a left-turn-only restriction.\n    *   **B. No:** This is correct. The ego vehicle is in a left-turn-only lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
