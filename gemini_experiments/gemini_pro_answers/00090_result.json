  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is stopped at a crosswalk, indicated by the thick white lines. There are two red traffic lights ahead. The road appears to be a two-way street, with parked cars on both sides in the distance. There is no moving car in this frame.\n*   **Frame 2:** Very similar to Frame 1. Still no moving car.\n*   **Frame 3:** A silver car is crossing the crosswalk, moving from the left side of the frame to the right. The ego vehicle's perspective hasn't changed, and the traffic lights are still red.\n*   **Frame 4:** Similar to frame 2, the moving car is no longer visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** Similar to frame 2 and 4, the moving car is no longer visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important frame is Frame 3, as it's the only one showing the moving car.\n*   The ego vehicle is stationary throughout all frames, waiting at a red light.\n*   The moving car is traveling perpendicular to the ego vehicle's direction.\n*   The moving car is going from the left to the right of the frame.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Same direction as ego:** Incorrect. The moving car is crossing the path of the ego vehicle, not traveling in the same direction.\n*   **B. Opposite direction from ego:** Incorrect. The moving car is crossing, not approaching or receding from the ego vehicle.\n*   **C. Left to right:** Correct. This aligns with the observation in Frame 3.\n*   **D. Right to left:** Incorrect. The car is clearly moving from left to right in Frame 3.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
