  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** The road appears to have two lanes in our direction, separated by a broken yellow line. A solid white line marks the right edge of the road. There is an intersection ahead, and the traffic light is red.\n*   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1, we are approaching the intersection. The lane markings remain the same.\n*   **Frame 3:** The two lanes are still visible. A bus is crossing the intersection from left to right. A sign on the right shows a right-turn arrow and a straight-ahead arrow.\n*   **Frame 4:** The bus continues to cross. The sign with the right-turn and straight-ahead arrows is more clearly visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** We are closer to the intersection. The sign is very clear now.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The most important piece of information is the sign visible in Frames 3, 4, and 5. This sign indicates the allowable movements for the *right* lane: straight ahead or right turn.\n*   The broken yellow line indicates that the left lane is for travel in the same direction as the ego vehicle. There are no signs restricting the left lane to left turns only.\n*   The presence of the bus crossing the intersection is not directly relevant to determining which lane the ego vehicle can use to go straight.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Left lane:** There are no signs or markings to suggest the left lane *cannot* go straight.\n*   **B. Right lane:** The sign explicitly states the right lane *can* go straight.\n*   **C. Left and right lane:** This combines the correct inferences from the previous two options.\n*   **D. None of the above:** This is incorrect, as the sign clearly allows the right lane to go straight.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
