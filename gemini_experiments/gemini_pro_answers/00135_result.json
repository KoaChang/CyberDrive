  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:**\n        *   Roadwork/construction is visible directly ahead, blocking the lane.\n        *   A \"LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\" sign is visible, indicating the left lane's restriction.\n        *   Traffic lights are present, with the left-turn arrow illuminated red.\n        *   A one-way sign is present, pointing to the right.\n        *   Ego is in the right lane.\n\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most critical observation across all frames is the roadwork blocking the lane directly ahead of the ego vehicle.\n    *   The \"LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT\" sign is relevant to the left lane, not the ego vehicle's lane.\n    *   The one way sign is for the cross street on the right.\n    *   The traffic lights, while present, don't restrict going straight in ego's lane *if* the lane were open. The obstruction is the primary issue.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. No because there are no signs in the scene that indicate ego's lane can go straight:** While it's true there are no explicit signs *permitting* straight travel, the lack of a sign isn't the primary reason. The obstruction is.\n    *   **B. No because roadwork has closed the lane ahead:** This aligns perfectly with the consistent observation of the roadwork blocking the lane.\n    *   **C. No because there is a one way sign:** The one-way sign applies to the cross-street, not the direction ego is facing.\n    *   **D. Yes:** This is incorrect because the road is clearly blocked.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
