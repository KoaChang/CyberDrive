  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the right lane. To the right of ego's lane is a solid white line. To the left of ego's lane is a double yellow line. There is a \"Fallen Rocks\" sign on the right side of the road.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1. The solid white line is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1 and 2. The solid white line is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as previous frames. The solid white line is still visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as previous frames. The solid white line is still visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The question asks about the *right* lane line in ego's lane.\n    *   All frames consistently show a solid white line to the right of the ego vehicle.\n    *   The left lane line is irrelevant.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Solid white line.** This matches the observations in all frames.\n    *   **B. Solid yellow line.** This is incorrect. Yellow lines are present, but they are to the *left* of the ego vehicle, separating oncoming traffic.\n    *   **C. Double yellow line.** This is incorrect. The double yellow line is to the left.\n    *   **D. Dotted white line.** This is incorrect. The line is solid, not dotted.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
