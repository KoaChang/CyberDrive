  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is behind a gray car. There's a double yellow line in the center of the road. There are parked cars on the right side of the road. There is an intersection ahead.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Similar to Frame 1. The gray car is still in front of ego.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Similar to Frame 2. The gray car is still in front of ego, and is approaching the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The gray car has entered the intersection and is turning left.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The gray car has almost completed its left turn.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The sequence of frames shows the gray car moving from directly in front of the ego vehicle to turning left at the intersection.\n    *   The double yellow line indicates that passing is prohibited, and it's a two-way street.\n    *   The parked cars on the right rule out a right turn onto the curb.\n    *   There is no indication of an emergency (no hazard lights, no sudden braking).\n    *   A U-turn is unlikely given the presence of the intersection and the smooth left turn.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Emergency pull over:** No evidence of emergency signals or sudden stopping.\n    *   **B. Right turn:** The car turned left, not right.\n    *   **C. Left turn:** This aligns with the observed movement of the gray car.\n    *   **D. U-turn:** While technically a type of left turn, the car's trajectory is a standard left turn at an intersection, not a U-turn.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
