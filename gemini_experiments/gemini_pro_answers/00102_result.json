  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is in a lane with a solid single yellow line to the left. There are multiple lanes, and the road appears to be a highway.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1. The solid single yellow line is clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1 and 2. The solid single yellow line is clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1, 2, and 3. The solid single yellow line is clearly visible.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1, 2, 3, and 4. The solid single yellow line is clearly visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The frames consistently show a solid single yellow line to the left of the ego vehicle.\n    *   The setting is consistently a multi-lane highway.\n    *   The yellow line indicates the leftmost boundary of travelable lanes, typically separating opposing traffic or marking the edge of the road.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Single white line:** Incorrect. The line is clearly yellow, not white.\n    *   **B. Double white line:** Incorrect. The line is yellow and single, not white and double.\n    *   **C. No lane lines:** Incorrect. A clear yellow line is visible in all frames.\n    *   **D. Single Yellow Line:** Correct. This matches the consistent observation across all frames.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>D</answer>\n"
