  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the rightmost lane. There are multiple traffic lights visible in the distance. The most prominent ones are a set of three: two green lights and one red light on the right. There is also a red light for right turn.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1, but ego is slightly closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1 and 2, but ego is even closer to the intersection.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as previous frames.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Ego is even closer to the intersection. The two leftmost lights are green, and the rightmost light is red. The red light for right turn is still visible.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   Ego's position: Ego remains in the rightmost lane throughout all frames.\n    *   Traffic light progression: The traffic lights remain consistent throughout the frames.\n    *   The question asks for the *most immediately relevant* light.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Red light:** This is a possibility, as there is a red light visible.\n    *   **B. Red light for right turn:** This is also a possibility.\n    *   **C. Yellow light:** There is no yellow light visible in any of the frames. This option can be eliminated.\n    *   **D. Green light:** There are two green lights, but they are not the most relevant to ego, given ego's lane position.\n\n    Considering ego is in the rightmost lane, and there is a red light in that lane, and a red light for right turn, the most relevant light is either the red light or the red light for right turn. Since the question asks for the *most* relevant, and ego could either go straight or turn right, both lights are equally relevant. However, the red light for right turn is specifically for turning, while the other red light is for going straight. Since the right turn light is more specific, it is slightly more relevant.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
