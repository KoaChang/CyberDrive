  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n*   **Frame 1:** A white car is passing from right to left in front of ego. No bus is visible. There is a street sign on the right.\n*   **Frame 2:** The white car is gone. No bus is visible.\n*   **Frame 3:** A grey car is passing from right to left. No bus is visible.\n*   **Frame 4:** The white car is back, passing from right to left. No bus is visible.\n*   **Frame 5:** A large bus is visible, moving from right to left across the frame.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n*   The question asks about the direction of the bus *with respect to ego*.\n*   The bus only appears in Frame 5.\n*   In Frame 5, the bus is clearly moving from the right side of the frame to the left side.\n*   Since the dashcam is forward-facing from the ego vehicle, this means the bus is crossing the ego vehicle's path from right to left.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Same direction as ego:** Incorrect. The bus is crossing the road, not traveling along it in the same direction as the ego vehicle.\n*   **B. Opposite direction from ego:** Incorrect. The bus is crossing, not approaching head-on.\n*   **C. Right to left:** Correct. This aligns with the bus's movement in Frame 5.\n*   **D. Left to right:** Incorrect. The bus moves from right to left.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>C</answer>\n"
