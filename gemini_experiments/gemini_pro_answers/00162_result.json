  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Ego is in the right-most lane. There are two lanes to the left of ego. The lane markings on the right are solid white, indicating the edge of the roadway or a separation from a shoulder. The lane markings to the left are dashed white, indicating that passing is allowed. There is a sign that says \"right lane only\".\n    *   **Frame 2:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Same as Frame 1.\n    *   **Frame 5:** Same as Frame 1.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The \"right lane only\" sign, the solid white line on the right, and the dashed white lines to the left consistently indicate that ego is in the right-most lane, and it is not merging. The lane is ending, and ego will have to merge to the left.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Ego is on the left most lane merging to the lane on the right.** Incorrect.

The frames and the sign indicate that ego is on the right-most lane.\n    *   **C. Ego is in the center lane merging to the lane on the left.** Incorrect. Ego is on the right-most lane.\n    *   **D. Ego is in the center lane merging to the lane on the right.** Incorrect. Ego is on the right-most lane.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>B</answer>\n"
