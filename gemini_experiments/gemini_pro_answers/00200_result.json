  "answer": "Here's a breakdown of the analysis and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection. There are multiple lanes. Critically, there's a white painted arrow on the road in the ego vehicle's lane, pointing left. The traffic lights are red.\n    *   **Frame 2:** The ego vehicle is closer to the intersection. The left-pointing arrow in the ego vehicle's lane is still clearly visible. The traffic lights remain red.\n    *   **Frame 3:** The ego vehicle is even closer, and the left-pointing arrow is still the dominant feature of the lane. The traffic lights are still red.\n    *   **Frame 4:** The ego vehicle is now very close to the intersection. The left turn arrow is prominent. The traffic lights have turned green.\n    *   **Frame 5:** The ego vehicle is at the intersection. The left turn arrow is still visible. The traffic lights are green.\n\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:**\n\n    *   The most important piece of information is the consistent presence of the left-pointing arrow in the ego vehicle's lane across all frames. This indicates that the lane is designated for left turns *only*.\n    *   The changing traffic light (red to green) indicates that when the light is green, the permitted maneuver is to turn left.\n    *   There are no other signs or markings that suggest any other maneuvers are allowed from this lane.\n\n3.  **Match to Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Turn left only:** This aligns perfectly with the left-pointing arrow observed in all frames.\n    *   **B. Turn right only:** This is incorrect; there's no indication of a right turn being allowed.\n    *   **C. Turn left and go straight:** This is incorrect; the arrow specifically points left, excluding the option to go straight.\n    *   **D. Turn right and go straight:** This is incorrect; there's no indication of either a right turn or going straight being allowed.\n\n4.  **Provide the Best Answer:**\n\n<answer>A</answer>\n"
