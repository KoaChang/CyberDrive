  "answer": "To determine if the ego vehicle can legally traverse straight through the intersection when the light turns green, we need to analyze the signs visible in the frames.\n\n1. **Frame 1**: \n   - There is a sign on the left that says \"YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS.\"\n   - Another sign in the center says \"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN.\"\n\n2. **Frames 2 to 8**: \n   - The signs remain consistent throughout these frames, confirming the instructions.\n\nThe key sign here is \"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN,\" which indicates that going straight is not a legal maneuver. The \"YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS\" sign is also present but does not directly affect the legality of going straight through the intersection.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
