  "answer": "To determine when ego can park at the side of the road, we need to examine the parking signs visible in the frames.\n\n1. **Frame 1-3**: The sign on the pole is not clearly visible.\n2. **Frame 4-8**: The sign becomes clearer. It appears to indicate parking restrictions.\n\nThe sign in frame 8 is crucial as it shows the parking restrictions. It seems to indicate that parking is allowed at certain times.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **A. 9am**: This is a common time for parking restrictions to start or end.\n- **B. 2pm**: This could be a time when parking restrictions are lifted.\n- **C. 8pm**: This is often a time when parking restrictions end.\n- **D. None of the above**: If the sign indicates a different time.\n\nBased on the visibility of the sign in frame 8, it seems to suggest that parking is allowed at 8pm, which is a common time for restrictions to end.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
