  "answer": "To determine what the white car is most likely to do at the stop sign, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-4**: The white car is approaching the stop sign. There are no visible turn signals, and the car is centered in the lane, suggesting it is not preparing to turn.\n\n2. **Frames 5-8**: The car continues straight, maintaining its position in the lane. There are no indications of a turn, such as a change in lane position or visible turn signals.\n\nBased on the frames, the car is most likely to proceed straight through the stop sign. There are no signs of turning or stopping beyond the required stop at the sign.\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
