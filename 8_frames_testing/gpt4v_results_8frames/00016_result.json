  "answer": "To determine the most appropriate maneuver for the ego vehicle, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-3**: The road curves to the left. The path ahead is clear, and there are no visible obstacles or signs indicating a change in direction.\n\n2. **Frames 4-5**: The road continues to curve left. The path remains clear, and the road appears to be a one-way street, as indicated by the \"One Way\" sign visible in frame 5.\n\n3. **Frames 6-8**: The road still curves left, and the \"One Way\" sign is more prominent. The path is clear, and there are no indications to reverse or turn right.\n\nGiven the consistent leftward curve of the road and the presence of a \"One Way\" sign, the most appropriate maneuver is to turn left to follow the road.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
