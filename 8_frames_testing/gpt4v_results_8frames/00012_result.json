  "answer": "To determine the available maneuvers through the intersection for the rightmost lane, we need to examine the traffic signs visible in the frames.\n\n1. **Frame 1**: The sign on the right side of the road indicates \"Right Lane Must Turn Right.\" This suggests that vehicles in the rightmost lane are required to turn right.\n\n2. **Frames 2-8**: The sign remains visible and unchanged, consistently indicating \"Right Lane Must Turn Right.\"\n\nBased on the consistent presence of the \"Right Lane Must Turn Right\" sign across the frames, the available maneuver for the rightmost lane is to turn right only.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
