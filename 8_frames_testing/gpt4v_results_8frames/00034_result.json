  "answer": "To determine the number of drivable lanes parallel to the ego vehicle, we need to analyze the frames for visible lane markings and traffic flow.\n\n1. **Frame 1**: Shows three lanes in the direction of the ego vehicle and two lanes in the opposite direction.\n2. **Frame 2**: Similar to Frame 1, confirming three lanes in the ego's direction and two in the opposite.\n3. **Frame 3**: Consistent with previous frames, showing three lanes in the ego's direction and two in the opposite.\n4. **Frame 4**: Continues to show the same lane configuration.\n5. **Frame 5**: Confirms the presence of three lanes in the ego's direction and two in the opposite.\n6. **Frame 6**: No change in lane configuration.\n7. **Frame 7**: Maintains the same lane structure.\n8. **Frame 8**: Final confirmation of three lanes in the ego's direction and two in the opposite.\n\nThroughout the frames, the road consistently shows three lanes in the direction of the ego vehicle and two lanes in the opposite direction, totaling five drivable lanes parallel to the ego vehicle.\n\nThus, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
