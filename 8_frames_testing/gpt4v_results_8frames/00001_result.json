  "answer": "To determine if ego's maneuver is legal, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-3**: Ego is behind a white vehicle, approaching an intersection. The right lane appears to be blocked by construction barriers, making it inaccessible for a right turn.\n\n2. **Frames 4-5**: Ego continues to follow the white vehicle, and the right lane remains blocked. The construction barriers are clearly visible, indicating that the right turn lane is not usable.\n\n3. **Frames 6-8**: Ego is now in a line of vehicles in the left lane, which is the only open lane. The right lane is still blocked by construction, confirming that a right turn is not possible from this position.\n\nBased on the frames, ego's maneuver to turn right would be illegal because the right turn lane is blocked by construction. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
