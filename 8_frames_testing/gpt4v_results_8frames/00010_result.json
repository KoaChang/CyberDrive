  "answer": "To determine how many traffic lights are relevant to the ego vehicle, we need to analyze the frames for visible traffic lights that would affect the vehicle's movement.\n\n1. **Frame 1**: Shows three red traffic lights. Two are on the left and one is on the right.\n2. **Frame 2**: Similar to Frame 1, three red traffic lights are visible.\n3. **Frame 3**: Again, three red traffic lights are visible.\n4. **Frame 4**: Three red traffic lights are visible.\n5. **Frame 5**: Three red traffic lights are visible.\n6. **Frame 6**: Three red traffic lights are visible.\n7. **Frame 7**: Three red traffic lights are visible.\n8. **Frame 8**: Three red traffic lights are visible.\n\nThroughout all frames, the same three traffic lights are consistently visible. These are the lights that would be relevant to the ego vehicle, as they are positioned to control the traffic flow in the direction the vehicle is facing.\n\nTherefore, the number of relevant traffic lights is **3**. However, since the options provided are 2, 4, 6, and 8, the closest logical choice is **2**, assuming one of the lights might be for a different lane or direction.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
