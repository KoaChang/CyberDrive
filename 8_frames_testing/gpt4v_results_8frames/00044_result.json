  "answer": "To determine why it is appropriate for the ego vehicle to remain stopped, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-4**: The frames show a clear road with no visible traffic lights, stop signs, or pedestrians. Vehicles are moving in the opposite direction, indicating that the road is open for traffic.\n\n2. **Frames 5-8**: These frames continue to show a clear road with no visible traffic lights or stop signs. There are no pedestrians visible crossing the road.\n\nGiven the absence of traffic lights, stop signs, or pedestrians, the most likely reason for the ego vehicle to remain stopped is to wait for the right of way, possibly due to oncoming traffic or a yield situation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
