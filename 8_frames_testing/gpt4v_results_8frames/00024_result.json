  "answer": "To determine which traffic light is most immediately relevant for the ego vehicle, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-3**: The vehicle is approaching an intersection. The traffic lights in the distance are visible, but their colors are not clearly discernible yet.\n\n2. **Frames 4-5**: The traffic lights become more visible. The main traffic light for the straight path is green.\n\n3. **Frames 6-8**: The green light for the straight path is clearly visible and remains green as the vehicle approaches the intersection.\n\nGiven the sequence of frames, the most immediately relevant traffic light for the ego vehicle is the green light, as it indicates that the vehicle can continue moving forward through the intersection.\n\n<answer>D</answer>",
