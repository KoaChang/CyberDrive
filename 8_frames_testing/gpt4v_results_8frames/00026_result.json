  "answer": "To determine which directions the ego vehicle can proceed in, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-4**: The road is clearly marked with cones, guiding the vehicle to stay on the right side. The path appears to be curving slightly to the right.\n\n2. **Frames 5-6**: A \"ROAD CLOSED\" sign becomes visible straight ahead, indicating that continuing straight is not an option. The cones continue to guide the vehicle to the right.\n\n3. **Frames 7-8**: The \"ROAD CLOSED\" sign is very clear, and the cones direct the vehicle to the right. There is no indication of a left turn option.\n\nBased on the frames, the ego vehicle cannot proceed straight due to the road closure. The only available direction is to the right.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
