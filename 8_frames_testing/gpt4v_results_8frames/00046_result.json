  "answer": "To determine the average speed of the truck, we need to assess the change in position of the truck relative to the road over the 5-second duration of the video.\n\n1. **Frame 1 to Frame 8 Analysis:**\n   - The truck is moving forward consistently across the frames.\n   - The distance between the truck and the background objects (e.g., road signs, buildings) increases steadily.\n   - The truck's position relative to the road markings also changes, indicating forward movement.\n\n2. **Key Observations:**\n   - The truck covers a noticeable distance over the 5-second period.\n   - The road sign in the background (visible in later frames) can be used as a reference for estimating speed.\n\n3. **Estimating Speed:**\n   - The truck appears to be moving at a moderate speed, not too slow and not extremely fast.\n   - Given the visible road sign indicating a speed limit of 24 miles per hour, the truck's speed is likely close to this limit.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the consistent forward movement and the reference to the speed limit sign, the truck's average speed is closest to 24 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n<answer>C</answer>",
