  "answer": "To determine the correct behavior for the ego vehicle, let's analyze the frames:\n\n1. **Frames 1-3**: The road ahead is clear, and there are no visible obstacles or pedestrians. The car on the right is parked off the road.\n\n2. **Frames 4-8**: The situation remains the same. The parked car is still off the road, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles in the path of the ego vehicle.\n\nBased on the frames, the road is clear, and there are no immediate threats or obstacles that require the ego vehicle to slow down or change direction. The parked car is not obstructing the road.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to continue straight in a nominal scenario.\n\n<answer>A</answer>",
